<p class="first">
  Always in the goal of being transparent as a blogger, I think it could be a good idea to have a disclosure page that will list who I work for, my affiliations with products and things like this. You will also notice that I mention when someone gives me something for free or to review in the blog post. Please note that I review only things I'd love, or things I want to share with you.
