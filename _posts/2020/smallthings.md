<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This afternoon I was walking from the florist where I acquired three small plants. First since I adopted my first cat, <a href="https://fred.dev/mylittlegirl/">Java</a>, who was eating them and getting sick. On my way back, I decided to stop at the coffee shop and grab a latte. I have a dual personality where I like my coffee strong and black, but I also love caffe latte. The air was cold but the sun was warming me at the same time. I was listening to the <a href="https://secularbuddhism.com/"><span class="s3">Secular Buddhism podcast</span></a> which is wisdom condensed in a short format of 20 to 30 minutes. At some point, I realized that I was </span><span class="s4">overly</span><span class="s1"> happy. I was smiling and feeling good.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What happened? I wasn't visiting a new country or having drinks with friends. After all, I was only walking back home. This walk </span><span class="s5">was embellished</span><span class="s1"> with little pleasures of mine: a podcast and a chilly but sunny day. I was also drinking a beverage I like while getting some green for my cozy home. Truth </span><span class="s5">be told</span><span class="s1">, I didn't go much to physical stores since the pandemic started. The current situation is causing me a lot of anxiety. The last time I had a latte was in February: I avoided anything from the outside world as much as possible. Damn, I miss coffee shops, but it's another topic. All that made me realize two things. First, I went beyond what I was capable of covid-wise without feeling too anxious. Trust me, this one is a huge win! Actually, I felt alive for the first time today since the beginning of this new world we live in. </span><span class="s4">Secondly</span><span class="s1">, happiness <b>is</b> in the small things. Quite intense for a trivial afternoon...</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Maybe there is a third learning opportunity from today: we should stop chasing happiness, and be content with what we have and who we are... Don't you think?</span></p>
