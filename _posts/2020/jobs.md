<div>I'm proud of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper">career I have</a> and what <a href="https://fred.dev/www/">I achieved</a> in the last couple of years. I acquired a great deal of experience as a software developer and now, as a developer advocate. One thing that may worry potential employers is the fact that I have a short turnover on most of the jobs I had. By respect for the companies, without going into details, here are the simple explanations for each one...</div>
<div></div>
<strong>MeiliSearch
</strong>They didn't like I tweeted about the fact that the people supporting RMS are people we shouldn't hire, and also when I said the CEO had no design taste.
<div></div>
<div><strong>DigitalOcean</strong></div>
<div>I would have been laid off a week after due to a reorganization.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>npm</strong></div>
<div>Cluster fuck with the upper management: the NLRB (United States National Labor Relations Board) was involved.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Fitbit</strong></div>
<div>I love challenges, but after months of flipping tables to get resources for my team, I realized developer relations weren't important for the company.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Mozilla</strong></div>
<div>All the developer relations team, including our manager, resigned within a month.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Microsoft</strong></div>
<div>Things changed after two amazing years: green KPIs at all cost and the end of open source love were against my principles.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>IBI Solutions</strong></div>
<div>All employees were laid off: the owner continued the business by himself.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>123Certification</strong></div>
<div>After 5 years in a psychological abusive environment, I had enough.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>So while I changed jobs too often for my own good, I guess it's life... Anyway, I ask nothing more than a place where I can grow within a great culture, a place I can use my expertise and hopefully stay for many years!</div>
