  <span class="s1">Let's be honest, looking for a job isn't something I enjoy, yet, here I am, searching for my next role. I dream of finding a company that understand developer relations and where I'll be able to grow for years. Shouldn't be too much to ask, or is it?</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I'm </span><span class="s3">primarily</span><span class="s1"> <b>looking for a Developer Advocate role</b>: this is where I am at my best. I'm open to an IC (Individual Contributor) or a manager job. I </span><span class="s3">truly</span><span class="s1"> enjoy sharing my passion about technology and helping developers being successful.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper/">strong experience</a>: eight years as a Software Developer and ten as a Developer Advocate. I've also worked at amazing companies like Microsoft, Mozilla, npm, Fitbit and DigitalOcean. <a href="https://fred.dev/speaking/">Public speaking is my superpower</a> and something I </span><span class="s3">truly</span><span class="s1"> enjoy: I gave more than 160 talks in 22 countries. I also have <a href="https://fred.dev/www/">a knack</a> for creating video content like podcasts or tutorials. Noteworthy, my previous coworkers said that I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/fharper">living on Twitter</a>!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To bring the most value to a company, I want to evolve in an environment where trust is a thing: you hire me for a reason! To be at my best, I need some level of freedom and stay away from micromanagement. I'm a fan of the lean startup approach: let's plan, execute, gather data, </span><span class="s4">evaluate</span><span class="s1"> and continue, stop or adjust our tactics. This is how I roll...</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One would say that it's a blessing to be Canadian, e</span><span class="s3">specially</span><span class="s1"> right now, but it's my biggest issue. It means that you need to be able to </span><a href="https://fred.dev/canada/"><span class="s3">legally hire me in Canada</span></a><span class="s1">. Don't worry, it's easier than you thought and I've been remote, working for US-based companies for the last ten years.</span><span class="s1"> Important to note that I don't want to </span><span class="s4">relocate</span><span class="s1"> in the United States or anywhere else in Canada. I would love to relocate somewhere in Europe though.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you are afraid of vocal people, don't <a href="https://fred.dev/workingwithme/">think about me</a>. If you don't value being bold, don't think about me. If you are not open to fighting the status quo when it makes sense, don't think about me. </span><span class="s5">If you are a company that don't value human life enough to be part of the social changes happening right now, don't even think about me</span><span class="s1">!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So, if you like cats (it's how I judge if you are a great person) and you think <strong>I am a FUCK YES</strong>, <a href="mailto:hi@fred.dev">drop me a line</a>.</span>
