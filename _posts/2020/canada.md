*tl;dr Pay the services of a Professional Employer Organization that will employ me: on paper I work for them in Canada, in reality I work for you. Not complicated and obviously legal.* <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">For the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper">last 10 years</a>, I've worked as a Developer Advocate for US-based companies. There are two reasons for that:</span>
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">This role is way more popular in American companies than in Canada. Most roles I've seen in Canada are in fact, for a company with root in the States;</span><span class="s2"> </span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">We </span><span class="s4">really</span><span class="s1"> don't pay well our tech people here. Say what you want about cost of living or anything else, it's true.</span><span class="s2"> </span>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With that said, quite often <i>they can't</i> hire me unless I move to their country. The problem is that I'm open to relocating, but not in the US or elsewhere in Canada. If I go to the troubles of starting a new life elsewhere, better be in EMEA, APAC or LATAM. To fix that, remote companies usually hire people as full-time contractors. They </span><span class="s5">are treated</span><span class="s1"> as any other employees </span><span class="s4">internally</span><span class="s1">, but on paper, they are contractors. It's one legal way to pay employees in countries where you don't have a legal entity. The problem is that I live in Québec, where our government likes to make things complicated.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In that case, the reality is that you are an employee. You have a manager, you have the company laptop and you aren't deciding when and how to do the work. This is how the government, if they investigate, is deciding that it’s fraud. You are a contractor on paper which is an employee in disguise. For them, it means that the company isn't paying the taxes they should pay when they hire someone </span><span class="s4">locally</span><span class="s1">. </span><span class="s6">Of course, they don't verify the situation of all contractors, but having one customer only for a year or two is a red flag</span><span class="s1">. There is no written rules, but to </span><span class="s4">fly</span><span class="s1"> under the radar, you need at least three customers. Beside the fact that I don't want to get contracts on the side, it is the law and I'm not a law breaker.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This situation leaves us with two options:</span>
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s3">Y</span><span class="s1">ou create a legal entity in Canada: it doesn't matter which provinces you do it, at that point you can hire me;</span><span class="s2"> </span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">You use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_employer_organization"><span class="s7">Professional Employer Organization</span></a> (PEO). They will be the middleman between your company and myself. On paper, I will work for them. You will pay them as a service provider including my compensation and a fee for their service.</span><span class="s2"> </span>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The first option is more beneficial if you plan to expand in any capacity in Canada. In the long run, you could save money. The latter is the perfect choice in most cases. Easy to set up and cost effective if you don't plan to expand that much in winterland. There are many companies out there doing that: I've heard about <a href="https://oysterhr.com">Oyster HR</a> It's more common than you think: when I was at Mozilla, they were using a PEO name <a href="https://www.trinet.com/"><span class="s7">TriNet</span></a> to hire me and my fellow Canadians.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the end, "I cannot hire you because you aren't based in the US" (or any other country for that matter) isn't a good reason. <strong>If I am a good fit, it's </strong></span><strong><span class="s4">really</span><span class="s1"> easy for you to hire me </span><span class="s4">legally</span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>.</strong> Think about it!</span>
