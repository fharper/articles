<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am now </span><span class="s3">actively</span><span class="s1"> looking for my next challenge: a place I'll be able to call home <b>for many years</b> to come. If you think you have a role for me, here is a cheat sheet for you.</span></p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>I want</b></span></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">a developer advocate role (IC or leadership): no, I won't go back as a developer full time;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">a real challenge: easy jobs bored me to death;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">certain freedom: I can't deal with micromanagement;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">diversification of the role: focus on writing content only is a technical writer job.</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>I am</b></span></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">extrovert, passionate, outspoken, colorful, bold and I tweet a lot: live with that, I won't change who I am;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">not cheap: I am at a principal level and I'm used to a San Francisco salary, yes, even if I live in Canada;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">working </span><span class="s3">remotely</span><span class="s1"> for the last 10 years: this won't change now;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">more than happy to work with a product or technologies I don't know: actually, I love that;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s3">really</span><span class="s1"> good at public speaking, making videos and creating real connections with developers.</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>I won't</b></span></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">work for any Facebook-owned companies, Uber (they fucked me once), New Relic (shitty CEO) or Amazon (I can't do the stupid loop);</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s7">relocate</span><span class="s1"> to the US;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">work in a startup that doesn't have at least a Series A;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">have goals that are too close to a dollar sign: developer relations is not sales or presales;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">work with people who do not like cats </span><span class="s8">&#x1f923;</span><span class="s2">
</span></li>
</ul>
