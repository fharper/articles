After a couple of weeks off, I’m back! Actually, it’s been two weeks that I’m working with customers, but I’m now ready to take more. Yes, that mean I decided to do some freelance work right now and have some opening.

Taking in consideration <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper">my experience</a>, and my passion, my offering is divided in three focus:
<ol>
 	<li>Helping companies of all size defining, and implementing an impactful business development strategy;</li>
 	<li>Providing startups with a clear plan to improve their internal development processes and technology choices including coaching;</li>
 	<li>Mentoring individuals to help define and enforce a tailored personal brand and public speaking skills to reach the next level in their career.</li>
</ol>
In the coming days, I’ll add detail on what that means for you and why we should work together. I also need to spare some time to work on my <a href="https://nolionisbornking.com/">business site</a>. Yes, no lion is born king is the name, because in the end, I want to help you be the king of your jungle…

Looking forward to <a href="mailto:fharper@oocz.net">working with you</a>!
