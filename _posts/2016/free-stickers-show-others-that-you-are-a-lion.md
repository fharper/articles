As I a <a href="https://fred.dev/open-for-new-contracts/">mentioned in February</a>, I decided to start my own business and go back to the marvellous world of freelancing with <a href="https://nolionisbornking.com">No lion is born king</a>. No need to say that it's an interesting time, not always easy, but overall, I'm quite happy! I'm also lucky as it's going well, thanks to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper">amazing network</a> I've built over the last couple of years and, of course, my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Success-Programming-Recognition-Influence-Personal-ebook/dp/B01JC1ML5Y/">personal brand</a>.

Talking about branding, I love my company's brand, and with the help of the talented <a href="https://fono.ca/">Sylvain Grand'Maison</a>, I've ordered some stickers to show how proud I am to the rest of the world. Since it's more than just a company's name, I would like to offer you some of those stickers so you can show others that you are a lion, a fighter, that you worked hard to become the king of your jungle. If you want some (size is 2X2 inches), please <a href="mailto:fharper@nolionisbornking.com?subject=NLIBK stickers">send me an email</a> with your complete postal address and I'll send you some for free. The only thing I'm asking in exchange is that you send me pictures of where you put them!

I can't wait to see with which other stickers my lion will hang with...
