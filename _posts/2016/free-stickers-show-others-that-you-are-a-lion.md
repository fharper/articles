As I a [mentioned in February][1], I decided to start my own business and go back to the marvellous world of freelancing with [No lion is born king][2]. No need to say that it's an interesting time, not always easy, but overall, I'm quite happy! I'm also lucky as it's going well, thanks to my [amazing network][3] I've built over the last couple of years and, of course, my [personal brand][4]. Talking about branding, I love my company's brand, and with the help of the talented [Sylvain Grand'Maison][5], I've ordered some stickers to show how proud I am to the rest of the world. Since it's more than just a company's name, I would like to offer you some of those stickers so you can show others that you are a lion, a fighter, that you worked hard to become the king of your jungle. If you want some (size is 2X2 inches), please [send me an email][6] with your complete postal address and I'll send you some for free. The only thing I'm asking in exchange is that you send me pictures of where you put them! I can't wait to see with which other stickers my lion will hang with...
