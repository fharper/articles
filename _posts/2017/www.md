When I have discussions about <a href="https://fred.dev/i-just-want-to-make-shit-happens-looking-for-a-new-opportunity/">what's next for me</a> (2017 article, still hold a lot of truth) and one question always comes back: where can I find more information about what you've done in your previous roles or your online presences. So here it is, a bunch of links about articles, social media, videos and more. Keep in mind that this blog is by far the best source of information on my way of thinking and who I am...
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper">LinkedIn</a>, which is basically my resume. No I don't have a Word document...

<h3>Public Speaking</h3>
An <a href="http://fred.dev/speaking/">exhaustive list of my previous talks</a> (160+ talks in more than 20 countries) containing direct links to recording, slides and articles. I've given online presentations, but also spoke at many offline events like conferences, workshops, panels and user groups in countries like Canada, Greece, USA, Hungary, France, Uruguay, Mexico, India, UK, Czech Republic, Spain, Poland, Ireland, Romania, Japan, Singapore, Australia...

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper">SlideShare</a>, all my presentations slides (slowly moving to <a href="https://speaking.fred.dev/">notist</a>).

Webinars like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WOgYfZgSf0">this one on Kubernetes</a> (most popular one at DigitalOcean - we maxed out the license we had, 1000)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/fharper">YouTube</a>, mostly some video interviews with influencers and many recordings of my talks.
<h3 id="writing">Some articles &amp; book</h3>

<h3>Some technical projects (my years as Software Developer)</h3>
I'm pragmatic, but I've always been more on the open side of things. Funny enough, most of my projects are coming with a lovely NDA and some are not even public.

<em>Note that in Québec, there is a strict law (!) about the title Engineer, so consider Software Developer as the same a Software Engineer everywhere else...</em>
