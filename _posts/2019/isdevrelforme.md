  <span class="s1">When I started my first role as a developer advocate in 2011, it was still an obscure one and not as popular as today. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing: I'm stoked that it's getting more and more popular. Even more important, great people have interest in this unique role. Companies now understand the return on investment. That </span><span class="s3">being said</span><span class="s1">, I often get questions about the role, so I decided to list some of the articles I wrote on the topic. My goal is helping the ones looking to make the jump in developer relations to understand the day to day. I hope it'll help you decide if it's a good fit for you...</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Keep two things in mind before reading those:</span>
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li3">
    <span class="s5">Those articles </span><span class="s3">are based</span><span class="s5"> on my vision of developer relations, which differ a lot from one company to another in the industry;</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li3">
    <span class="s1">Some articles are old, but still relevant. When you read "technical evangelist", it applies to "developer advocate". When I started, the latter didn't exist, and I always considered them as the same.</span><span class="s2"> </span>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s5">I may add more articles in the future, and even some external resources to give you some nuance and other points of view</span><span class="s1">.</span>
