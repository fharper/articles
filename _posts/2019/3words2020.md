Last year, I decided not to choose my 3 words for 2019. I thought that this exercise wasn't that useful. I realized now that I was wrong. They had a bigger impact than I thought, and it's why I'm back at it for 2020. 
## Self-love The last years have not been gentle on me. It may be hard to believe if you've seen me at work, but my self-esteem and my self-confidence were badly hurt. Focusing on self-love means that I will learn to love myself (again). It means, taking care of myself, mentally, but even more, 

[physically][1]. It is the one thing that could positively and hugely impact all other areas of my life. It's about listening to myself and prioritizing my well-being. It's also, if not more, about self-compassion. 
## Intentional Intentional mean done on purpose. It's exactly what I want to do: be more deliberate with my actions. Trying to be less impulsive and more thoughtful. Planning more, and setting clear, written and specific goals. It's also living according to my values. 

## Meaningful Early in my life, I achieved most of the goals I had. Since I often feel like I'm a zombie, living day after day without a purpose. I don't know what's next for me, so I want to bring more meaning to my life. I want to have more meaningful relationships and fewer mindless activities. I want to live more. I want to be more. Those words will guide me throughout the next year, helping me become my best self! In 2020, I will be more intentional, make my life more meaningful and focus on self-love... How about you? How do you envision and empower yourself for the next 365 days? P.S.: my 

[2013][2] (first year, explaining where this concept comes from and why I decided to follow it), [2014][3], [2015][4], [2016][5], [2017][6] and [2018][7] words.
