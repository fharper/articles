<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Time flies. Six months ago, <a href="https://fred.dev/digitalocean/">I started a new role at DigitalOcean</a>, aka DO. I was coming in with a lot of excitement about this new challenge. I was also bringing a lot of apprehensions based on recent experiences. One hundred eighty-four days later, I can't be happier of the choice I've made.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">DO Culture</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's one thing to have the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/about/">company's values</a> written on the website, it's another to live them and DigitalOcean do. It is critical for me that my employer has values that I respect. The company's culture is the foundation of my decision to join or not a new adventure. Simplicity, trustworthy, speaking up, and love are part of my personal values. Listening, respect and the community-driven approach are part of my professional values too. Can the fit be better, </span><span class="s3">I think</span><span class="s1"> not! I can see those throughout the work and the daily interactions of my colleagues. </span><span class="s4">These resonate into the Developer Relations team, which has <a href="https://fred.dev/isdevrelforme/">the same vision as me</a> on how we can help developers being successful while contributing to the company growth</span><span class="s1">. We spend so much time at work, loving what we do is important.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">DO People</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people you hire are a reflection of your values, and the foundation of your company. I cannot write about all the organization, but the people I've worked with or meet </span><span class="s3">really</span><span class="s1"> are amazing. They are folks who care! They care about their work. They care about the community. They care about our customers and most important, they care about each other. </span><span class="s5"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3tSPSkn5VU/">My team</a> (Developer Relations), my virtual team (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/hatch/">Hatch program</a>) and my department (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community">Community</a>) </span><span class="s6">are composed</span><span class="s5"> of a bunch of lovely humans</span><span class="s1">. Love and people first, seem to be our unofficial motto.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">DO Care</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I'm a big believer that you should trust, empower, and invest in your people. After all, the company wouldn't exist without them! There are different ways to do that. </span><span class="s5">On the trust and empowerment level, the space <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddiezane/">my manager</a> gives me to be creative and achieving my goals is a perfect example</span><span class="s2">. He is there to support me when needed, but leave me the space I need to be successful and happy at work. DO invest in their employees in many ways. Of course, compensations and benefits are </span><span class="s3">really</span><span class="s2"> good, but for me, it's the attention to details. As an example, since I don't have access to the offices' perks, I receive coffee and snacks at home monthly. I can definitely afford those, but it's one way to make remotes feel they are part of the company. Another example that I cherish a lot is the fact that, once a month, I can order an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38754302-fr-d-ric-harper?shelf=do">ebook that will help me with my work</a>. They are small gestures, but with more than 600 employees, it adds up </span><span class="s3">quickly</span><span class="s2"> finance-wise. Here, I'm not even talking about the fact we just had a company offsite at Disney Land...</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, no place is perfect, and we have some glitches here and there, but overall, DO is one of the best workplaces I had. The best thing about all this is that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Bm5UNnNhZ/">they seem to appreciate me</a>! I know it's <a href="https://fred.dev/workingwithme/">not always easy to work with a strong personality like mine</a>, but they get along with the good, the bad, and the ugly... I'm also proud of what I've accomplished and the impact I had, which is important for me. So after 27 weeks at DigitalOcean, I </span><span class="s3">sincerely</span><span class="s1"> hope that it's only the beginning of my journey with Sammy the shark!</span></p>
