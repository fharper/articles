<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I miss her. I miss my little girl. I miss Java, my cat. I loved her. I love her. Two weeks ago, she left me. She was too sick. I had to. I wanted to be selfish. I wanted to keep her still. I wanted us to have many more years together. I had to. I had to let her go. For her. I didn't want my Java to suffer. It was hard. It's still hard. I miss her so much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I spent more than one third of my life with her. She was 14 years old. It's a good life for a cat you will tell me. I will answer you that I was expecting a lot more. She was healthy, until she was not. It went so fast. It went too fast. For many, it's hard to understand, but she was like a kid to me. She was my little girl! How dare I compare an animal to a human? I dare. I loved her. But it's fine. You don't have to understand. I don't need you to. That won't heal my wounds. That won't stop the suffering. She was my little girl. My girl. Java.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not there anymore, waiting for me to get out of the shower.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not lying next to my head anymore, waiting for me to fall asleep to run some errand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not inspecting every new item entering my place anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not sleeping between me and my keyboard with her little head on my wrist anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not looking at me with her eyes </span><span class="s3">clearly</span><span class="s1"> saying, I love you hooman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She is not there anymore... my little girl!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Hopefully</span><span class="s1">, she had a great life. I hope she did. She had everything she needed and more. She </span><span class="s4">was loved</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">probably</span><span class="s1"> too much for her own good sometimes. She loved too. </span><span class="s3">Hopefully</span><span class="s1">, I have great memories of her. </span><span class="s3">Hopefully</span><span class="s1">, I have great memories with her. I still love her. I still miss her. Time will help, but time will never make me forget her. After all, she was my little girl...</span></p>
