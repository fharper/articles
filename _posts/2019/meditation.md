<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the last years, I started to take my mental health more </span><span class="s3">seriously</span><span class="s1">. One tool I discovered is meditation. It's been about a year now that I meditate daily. Of course, it wasn't without struggles, e</span><span class="s3">specially</span><span class="s1"> being in the far right end of the ADHD spectrum. Still I see tangible benefits of being constant with my practice. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It helped me with my </span><span class="s4">overall</span><span class="s1"> mindfulness, and lowering down my anxiety. </span><span class="s5">It supported me in my journey to live a more meaningful life by enhancing my self-awareness which also helped me better manage my emotions</span><span class="s1">. It was also a way to prove myself that I can and should take better care of my physical and mental health. </span><span class="s5">Often forgotten as a plus, it is giving me a moment of quietness and a way to slow down in a world where everything goes fast</span><span class="s1">!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Even if the principle is simple, it can be intimidating at the beginning. I started with guided meditations using the <a href="https://www.calm.com/"><span class="s6">Calm</span></a> app (available on iOS and Android). Having a guided voice was helping me understand what I was doing. I even went to a local Buddhist temple for an introduction course on the topic. </span><span class="s5">Meditation is often associated with Buddhism, but there is no need for you to follow this philosophy</span><span class="s1">. Today, I use no app and no music, as I found it was easier for me after a couple of months, to do it in silence. I now meditate 30 minutes per day, but it is not a competition. You can start with as little as five minutes, which is enough to have a positive impact.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s5">There are many ways to meditate, but in its simplest form, the process is not complicated, but can be frustrating at first</span><span class="s1">. No need for special decorum. The only thing you need to do is to focus on the airflow that goes in and out of your nostrils when you breathe </span><span class="s3">normally</span><span class="s1">. The idea isn't to stop thinking. </span><span class="s5">It's about bringing back the focus on your breath when you realize your mind is wandering elsewhere</span><span class="s1">. It's important to acknowledge the thoughts you have without judgment. It was the part I struggled the most when I started. It frustrated me that I wasn't able to "stop thinking”. When I understood it wasn't the goal, it became a lot more enjoyable. Now, I am able to focus a lot more on my breath before another thought arises.</span>

  <span class="s1">This article is a quick glimpse of my meditation journey. I hope it is helping you understand how it can be beneficial for you also. Now that you have an idea how, start today and take five minutes during your lunch break. Sit at your desk, close your eyes and focus on your breath... Who knows, you may become addicted to meditation!</span>
