It’s not a secret. I try to keep in mind a list of ways to live my life. At this very moment, it’s not complicated as everything is part of my lifestyle for a long time now. Here is my life manifesto:</p><ol><li>Be authentic;</li><li>Do what you love;</li><li>Have no regrets;</li><li>Do it;</li><li>Don’t care about the other;</li><li>Go out of your comfort zone.</li></ol><p>Let me explain these 6 little rules:</p><h3><strong>Be authentic</strong></h3><p>Be yourself in every situation. Every situation! People will love you for yourself, if they don't, they don't deserve you. Trust me, it's not always easy to be yourself in all situations, but you'll be happier.</p><h3><strong>Do what you love</strong></h3><p>Also in every situation, do what you love. If you don't love what you are doing, do something else. If you have some problems to wake up in the morning to go to work, change your job. It's easier than you think.</p><h3><strong>Have no regrets</strong></h3><p>If you think you'll have regrets if you are not doing it, do it. It's better to leave with remorse than with regrets.</p><h3><strong>Do it</strong></h3><p>Don't wait for the other, do it yourself. Do it, ask it, worst case it won't work. You think that this event should be awesome if someone creates it, create it. You want to lose weight, make some exercices. As simple as this.</p><h3><strong>Don't care about the other</strong></h3><p>I don't talk here about anarchism. I talk about not wearing clothes or listening to music to be accepted by other. I'm talking about going outside or your house even if you have not taken the time to put some make-up. Don't care about what people think if you are comfortable with what you are doing, wearing, listening, watching, thinking...</p><h3><strong>Go out of your comfort zone</strong></h3><p>Always push your limits. If you are afraid or stress to do something and want to do it, do it! After the first, second or third time, it's gonna be something normal for you. Your limits will be bigger than the last time.</p><p>I hope this list will help you find a way, your way, of living your life. It’s simple, but so powerful. <strong>Life is short. We need to lives it as we want! Why don’t you do your own list? Do you have rules for your life?</strong></p><p style="text-align:center"><em>Creative Commons image: <a title="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44442915@N00/4574733303/" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44442915@N00/4574733303/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/44442915@N00/4574733303/</a></em></p>
