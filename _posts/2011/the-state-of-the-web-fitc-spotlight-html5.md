It was a full day of HTML5 presentations in one track. It was my first experience at FITC and I enjoyed it.

  Many years have passed since the invention of the Web. More than ever, the Web is present in our life, and it's a powerful tool that helps us on every part of it. Whether they use PCs, tablets, slates or smart phones, people have access everywhere, and every time they want to this continual flow of information. As a developer, we are now empowered to create a more beautiful Web with all these new technologies. You can think about this cloud thing or the latest version of HTML that are there to help us keep the pace. Let's explore together the actual state of the Web, the challenge we are facing and the opportunity that will make us successful.

  As promised, these are my slides for the presentation I did around the state of the Web and HTML5.

  Here are some of the main ideas behind the keynote I did:
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>The problems</strong>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  There are some problems with the industry right now. It goes too fast for us, developers, but also for consumers. We have so many choices and so little time to do the right ones. We have to work with many devices like PCs, laptops, tablets, slates and smartphones. It makes our work more complex than ever.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>The choices</strong>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="color:#333">As I said, we have many choices. We can use this new thing called <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Computing</a>. We have many programming languages we can work with. All these choices can lead to the success or the failure of our products, our company and even our career.</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>The solution</strong>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="color:#333">I should write, one of the solutions. I think that one of the solutions is HTML5. This version of HTML opens a new set of opportunity. To help attendees go away with useful information and skills that they can use right now, I make an overview on some of the HTML5 features that they can use after the conference HTML5 is bigger  than this, but I highlighted the one I think would help us succeed when we make the choice of the technology we will use. Please keep in mind that when I talked about HTML5, I always include CSS3 and JavaScript inside it.</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I talked about semantics tags, Web Open Font Format, CSS3 Media Queries, video tag, canvas, SVG and different ways to adopt HTML5 today. I also talk about the fact that by using these languages, you already got access to many frameworks, but also, already, many tools to help you be more productive.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>So, did you assist this presentation? What did you think? Even if you didn’t see it, what do you think about HTML5? Do you think it’s one of the technologies of the future? What is your thought about the Web industry right now? Share your mind…</strong>
