I'm the kind of guy who buys a book, start reading it, do something else, buy a new book, start to read it and so on. I have a couple of books unfinished or not even started with a couple more in my wish list. I enjoy reading and I want to read more, so I was thinking about doing something related to this blog, something calls "Show me your book". <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The principle is simple. I'll try to read one book per month, that give me something like ten pages per day, a lot more than I used to read. After the book is finished, I'll write a blog post to share with you. Nothing complicated, just a text that will give you the big picture and my appreciation. I own a <a title="Kobo eReader" href="https://www.kobobooks.com/wifi">Kobo</a> (thinking of buying the new one, the <a title="Kobo Touch eReader" href="https://www.kobobooks.com/touch">Kobo Touch</a>), so it's not a big deal to always have the book I'm reading with me. I don't really read story books (except for some of my friends' books or comics books like <a title="The Walking Dead Website" href="https://www.walkingdead.com/">The Walking Dead</a>) as I prefer the one that talks about topics like success, efficiency in the professional life, a better way of living, social media...
