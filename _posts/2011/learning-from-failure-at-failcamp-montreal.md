<p style="text-align:justify"><img title="failcampmtl" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/failcampmtl.png" alt="" width="300" height="291"/>You remember the post I did about <a title="Blog post about celebrating failure" href="https://fred.dev/celebrate-failure/">celebrating failure</a>? In this post, I was sharing with you how I think we can learn from error or failure we had in our life. I was also talking about, maybe, doing an event where people would be able to share about failure they had and the lesson they got from it. I cannot stop myself for doing it, so I created <a title="FailCamp Montreal website" href="https://failcampmtl.org/">FailCamp Montreal</a>.</p<p style="text-align:justify">What is a FailCamp? Is this an event where we will watch together images of <a title="Funny website of people of Walmart" href="https://www.peopleofwalmart.com/photos">people at Walmart</a> or get the better fail from <a title="Failblog" href="https://failblog.org/">failblog</a>? Not really! FailCamp is a celebration of failure. It’s about sharing your tales of epic fail and the lessons you learned from them. It’s about learning not to view failure as a defeat, but as a learning opportunity and stepping stone to success. It’s about taking away the fear of failure and learning to take a chance, think big and achieve what you thought you couldn’t.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This first edition will happen on the 21th of September starting at 19h00. It's totally free, but you have to get your ticket at <a title="FailCamp Montreal EventBrite" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/event/486528219">EventBrite</a>. At this time, we have more than the half of tickets gone, and I didn't start to make some promotion, so hurry before we go sold out. I already have two speakers confirmed.</p> [gallery exclude="324" link="file" columns="2"]<p>It's a great pleasure for me to have these two guys speak at this event, and I'm sure they'll have awesome things to share with you. <strong>If you believe in learning from your failure, even if you cannot attend, please promote the event in your network.</strong> I hope to see you there!</p>
