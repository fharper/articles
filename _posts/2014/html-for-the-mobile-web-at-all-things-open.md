In about a month, I'll speak at [All Things Open][1] in Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm quite excited as even if I never attended this event, I hear a lot of good things about it. Funny enough, I don't go on stage quite often in the United States, so it's a great opportunity to do so. What could be a better topic than talking about HTML for the Mobile Web at an event like this? 
> Firefox OS is a new operating system for mobile phones to bring web connectivity to those who can not get top-of-the-line smartphones. By harvesting the principles of what made the web great and giving developers access to the hardware directly through web standards it will be the step we need to make a real open and affordable mobile web a reality. In this talk, Frédéric Harper from Mozilla will show how Firefox OS works, how to build apps for it and how end users will benefit from this open alternative to other platforms. It's not too late to [register for this event][2] on October 22-23: they still have early birds tickets. See you there to share, and discuss with you about open source, open tech and the open web!
