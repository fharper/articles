Travelling for work give me great opportunities: I can discover new cities, and the next one, <a title="I’ll speak at PragueJS, in Prague, Czech Republic" href="http://fred.dev/ill-speak-at-praguejs-in-prague-czech-republic/">as you may know</a>, is Prague. Funny enough, even if Prague is a popular destination, it's the one I have fewer insight on what to do as a tourist. There is a lot of suggestions on the web, but nothing that excited me like in other cities. Don't get me wrong, I'm so happy to visit Prague, but I think I need to find new things to do.

So for now, from what I found on the web, my list will include:
<ul>
 	<li><a title="The Prague Castle website" href="https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/prague-castle-tourist-information/visit-of-prague-castle.shtml">The Prague Castle;</a></li>
 	<li><a title="St. Nicholas' Church website" href="http://www.stnicholas.cz/en/">St. Nicholas' Church</a> because I like to visit one church in every new city: their architecture are amazing;</li>
 	<li><a title="The Lennon Wall Wikipedia page" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon_Wall">The Lennon Wall</a> because I like the Beatles;</li>
 	<li><a title="Old Town (Stare Mesto) website" href="https://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Facts-about-the-Czech-Republic/Old-Town-%28Stare-Mesto%29">Old Town (Stare Mesto)</a> will be a nice place to walk, and discover the city, and his treasures;</li>
 	<li><a title="Prague Astronomical Clock Wikipedia page" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_astronomical_clock">Astronomical clock</a> because it seems to be one of the main attraction of Prague with the castle.</li>
</ul>
On the food side of the experience, I got a lot of good suggestions:
<ul>
 	<li><a title="Brewbar Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brewbar/491780760907331">Brewbar</a> is a coffee stand at the Naplavka farmer's market. The owner is an amazing barista we hired for the Firefox OS booth at the Mobile World Congress. It was the best coffee I ever had, so I'll repeat the experience there;</li>
 	<li><a title="Strahov Monastic Brewery website" href="https://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/">Strahov Monastic Brewery</a> for a good local beer;</li>
 	<li><a title="Čestr Ambiente website" href="http://cestr.ambi.cz/en/">Čestr Ambiente</a> for a good meal;</li>
 	<li><a title="Lokál Dlouhá website" href="http://lokal-dlouha.ambi.cz/en/">Lokál Dlouhá</a> seems to be a nice little restaurant for something fast, but fresh, and tasteful;</li>
 	<li><a title="Café Imperial website" href="https://www.cafeimperial.cz/en/">Café Imperial</a> for another great meal.</li>
</ul>
For the prepaid sim card, I think I'll go with <a title="Vodafone Czech Republic website" href="https://www.vodafone.cz/en/">Vodafone</a> except if you told me not. I've been served well in many European countries: the network is usually good, and the price is cheap. They even have a stand at the airport, which I like as it will be easier for me.

As usual, I'll find a <a title="Czech Republic Starbucks" href="https://www.starbuckscoffee.cz/">Starbucks</a> to see if they have local coffee mugs, and I'll do one or more <a title="My Geocaching profile" href="https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=7feede35-46e4-45da-a4d7-4c4bef7b729c">geocaches</a>, but is there anything I'm missing? Anything in my list I should skip? Any attraction I need to see or activities I should do? I know I need to taste one of the Czech Republic speciality alcohol called <a title="Slivovitz Wikipedia Article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz">Slivovitz</a>, but is there any typical food I should try too? Help me make this trip even better than it will be!

<em>P.S.: Since you always discover new things once on site, and that some stuff I listed may not be as good as it seems, I'm planning to share my insight, in a blog post form, about the cities I've visited to help others have an even better experience.</em>
