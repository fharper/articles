As you may know, <a title="Rire de moi pour une bonne cause" href="http://fred.dev/rire-de-moi-pour-une-bonne-cause/">I was part of a fundraising</a> (French post) for the <a title="Marie-Vincent Foundation website" href="https://marie-vincent.org/en/">Marie-Vincent Foundation</a>. I was one of the IT leaders in the Montreal industry, along with friends as the guys of Real Venture, to sing a song in front of the attendees. The goal was to raise money for the foundation. If you know me, you know that I do not care about being laughed at. I also have no problem to be on stage in front of people, but I need to admit I was stressed out for this one. You can watch the damage here...

<em>The voice level was lower during the event to keep attendees from running away, so I guess they recorded directly from my mic output.&lt;/em It was a fantastic experience! I discovered an amazing foundation, for a cause that shouldn't exist in a better world. I had the pleasure to sing a song with a live band, and they were amazing. Not that I did not have respect for group signers, but now, my respect level for them reach a new level. The song I choose, Get Lucky from Daft Punk, was energetic, and people were dancing. It sure has a special place in the epic shit list of things I did in my life!</em>
