A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by [Mathieu Laferrière][1] to answer a couple of questions about the future of work. He was conducting interviews for the future of work project of [Bill Jensen][2]. In this nine minutes video, I answered those questions: 
1.  What choices have made you... you?
2.  The toughest challenges facing all leaders in leading other into the future [of work]?
3.  How can we help those leaders make those tough choices?
4.  Your biggest lessons learned?

</div> I'm having a blast for the last couple of years: working at home, no schedule, doing something I like. I've never been so productive, and I hope this small interview will help employers to understand the benefits of being more open. I also hope that it will help you, find the thing you like to do for a living, and be happy when you wake up on Monday morning...
