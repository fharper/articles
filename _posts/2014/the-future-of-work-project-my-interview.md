A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by <a title="Mathieu Laferrière website" href="https://mathieulaferriere.com/">Mathieu Laferrière</a> to answer a couple of questions about the future of work. He was conducting interviews for the future of work project of <a title="Bill Jensen website" href="https://www.simplerwork.com/">Bill Jensen</a>. In this nine minutes video, I answered those questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What choices have made you... you?</li>
 	<li>The toughest challenges facing all leaders in leading other into the future [of work]?</li>
 	<li>How can we help those leaders make those tough choices?</li>
 	<li>Your biggest lessons learned?</li>
</ol>

I'm having a blast for the last couple of years: working at home, no schedule, doing something I like. I've never been so productive, and I hope this small interview will help employers to understand the benefits of being more open. I also hope that it will help you, find the thing you like to do for a living, and be happy when you wake up on Monday morning...
