<figure><img alt="speakup" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/speakup.jpg" width="600" height="337"/><figcaption> Creative Commons: https://j.mp/1g31Ok3</figcaption></figure><p>One thing I like to do when someone ask me to speak at their event, is to let them know that they can count on an experienced, professional, and authentic speaker. I always had a <a title="Speaking page on my site" href="http://fred.dev/speaking/">speaking page</a> on this blog, but the information wasn't well presented. I decided to do a good cleanup, and finalize the page to give more information to conferences, and user groups organizers, but also to my readers.</p><p>Thanks to <a title="Lea Verou's website" href="https://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a>, and his <a title="Lea Verou talks project on GitHub" href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/talks">talks projects on GitHub</a>, it will be easier than ever to list all the talks I'll do. I listed all the keynotes, presentations, and panels I did since I started to do public speaker about three years ago: it's interesting to see that <a title="Speaking page on my site" href="http://fred.dev/speaking">I'll reach one hundred talks in height countries soon</a>! The new speaking experience section make it easier to find the video recordings, slides, post-mortem blog posts of my talk. It also gives you an idea of the countries where I spoke, the talks I'll do, and more information on those events with a direct link to their sites. You also have access to some testimonial (ahum, bragging) of previous attendees, and access to what I call <a title="My speaking kit" href="https://fred.dev/images/2011/08/Harper_Frederic-Speaking_Kit.zip">my speaker kit</a>: a zip file with three different pictures of me, and three versions of my biography in French, and in English (from very small to usual size for conferences).</p><p>I still need to play a little more with the CSS on that page as some stuff aren't aligned as I would like to, but still, I'm very happy with this new page. Since speaking is a big part of what I do for a living (technical talks on topics like Firefox OS), but also what I do on my own time for pleasure (non-technical talks on topics like <a title="Information on my book on Personal Branding" href="https://book.fred.dev/">Personal Branding</a>), I wanted my site to showcase my experience, and of course, get more exposure out of it. If you want to check what to expect from me as a speaker, and how you can book me for a talk, <a title="So you want me to speak at your event?" href="https://fred.dev/so-you-want-me-to-speak-at-your-event/">check this post</a>. In the end, it's all about sharing my passion with others!</p>
