<img src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/listen.jpg" alt="Creative Commons: https://j.mp/KyiqUp" width="600" height="400" /> I love books. Actually, it's not true: I like good, and valuable content. It happens that quite often, a book contains excellent stuff, but I have no attachment to the physical element. I don't read science fiction, but I'm a big fan of books about being more efficient, marketing stuff, having a better life... The way I'm shaping my days, I don't take too much time to read, but it's a shame, as I would like to read more books or ebooks. I read content on the web quite often. I also read some comic books before going to bed as I want to relax, and turn my brain off. So what about those books that I like to read, but don't take too much time to do so? Always trying to maximize my time, I started to read, hum, to listen to audio book using [Audible][1]. The idea is simple: someone is reading the book for you, and you just have to listen. Since the format change, and open new possibilities, I can now listen to a book while taking a walk, doing my workout at the gym, or while using the public transit. Just in the last three months, I listened to: 
1.  [Free: The Future of a Radical Price][2] by Chris Anderson;
2.  [Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us][3] by Seth Godin;
3.  [Remote: Office Not Required][4] by Jason Fried, and David Heinemeier Hansson;
4.  [The Icarus Deception: How High Will You Fly?][5] by Seth Godin;
5.  [Ctrl Alt Delete: Reboot Your Business. Reboot Your Life. Your Future Depends on It.][6] by Mitch Joel;
6.  [Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable][7] by Seth Godin. Except the fact that you can see that I like 

[Seth Godin][8], those six books represent more books consumed than an entire year, where I usually read one to three maximum. This new way of consuming information for me is wonderful, and I think I'll even have to upgrade my Audible account to be able to get more book. Not all the books are there, but since I tend to look for books people suggest me, they seems to be quite popular, and fortunately, has been created as audiobooks too. Are you reading a lot of books? Do you prefer ebooks? Or maybe you already a fan of audio books? Where do you find good content? Any book suggestions? Creative Commons: https://j.mp/KyiqUp
