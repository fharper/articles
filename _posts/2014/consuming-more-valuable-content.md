I love books. Actually, it's not true: I like good, and valuable content. It happens that quite often, a book contains excellent stuff, but I have no attachment to the physical element.

I don't read science fiction, but I'm a big fan of books about being more efficient, marketing stuff, having a better life... The way I'm shaping my days, I don't take too much time to read, but it's a shame, as I would like to read more books or ebooks. I read content on the web quite often. I also read some comic books before going to bed as I want to relax, and turn my brain off. So what about those books that I like to read, but don't take too much time to do so? Always trying to maximize my time, I started to read, hum, to listen to audio book using <a title="Audible website" href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a>. The idea is simple: someone is reading the book for you, and you just have to listen. Since the format change, and open new possibilities, I can now listen to a book while taking a walk, doing my workout at the gym, or while using the public transit. Just in the last three months, I listened to:

</ol>
Except the fact that you can see that I like <a title="Seth Godin's blog" href="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, those six books represent more books consumed than an entire year, where I usually read one to three maximum. This new way of consuming information for me is wonderful, and I think I'll even have to upgrade my Audible account to be able to get more book. Not all the books are there, but since I tend to look for books people suggest me, they seems to be quite popular, and fortunately, has been created as audiobooks too. Are you reading a lot of books? Do you prefer ebooks? Or maybe you already a fan of audio books? Where do you find good content? Any book suggestions?
