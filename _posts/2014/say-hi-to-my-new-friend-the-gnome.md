<figure><img alt="fharper" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fharper.png" width="600" height="600"/></figure><a title="I want a logo, any designer out there?" href="https://fred.dev/i-want-a-logo-any-designer-out-there/">I wanted a logo</a>, and I also wanted to try <a title="99Designs website" href="https://99designs.ca">99designs</a> as I heard a lot about it in the startups space: since this logo was just for fun, and not a real need, I thought I could try it. I'm not a big fan of this kind of website where many designers compete against each other without being paid (only the winner will), but I was really please of the result: I got a lot of submissions from many designers, an amazing winning logo, and have a new great designer in my network.<p>Why a logo? As I said, it was mostly for fun: I saw some friends of mine, and people I admire have one, so I thought it wouldn't hurt. It's also a next step in my <a title="I’m working on a personal branding book for developers" href="https://fred.dev/im-working-on-a-personal-branding-book-for-developers/">personal brand</a>, a way to identify my work more easily. I was thinking about adding watermark to my videos, images, and <a title="Speaking page on my site" href="http://fred.dev/speaking/">presentations</a>. It will also be a way to differentiate myself from others, and easily be identified (or my work).</p><p>A gnome, seriously? A couple of months ago, I was looking for a funny title for a presentation, and I ended up with a gnome, and an unicorn in the title. I thought those two were representing my funny, extravert, not always serious, and magical (what?) side, so I added them to my actual biography. I thought that if I was going to have a logo, it should be something more less gray, something that would represent me: the gnome was the first that come to mind!</p><p>The hardest part with 99designs was to give feedbacks as I know they are not getting paid right now, and won't if they don't win the contest. When I was a freelancer, I didn't accept anything like this, but they decided to participate knowing the rules.... As you can see, this logo fits me, and respects the criteria I had:</p><ul><li>Using the two colors on this blog (even if the logo isn't for the blog);</li><li>A gnome (I was open to anything else that fits my personality/job/passions, but all designers were excited about the gnome idea);</li><li>Simplicity was the keyword (I didn't want something complex - I'm a simple guy, and I like clean design);</li><li>Looking good in black/white (you never know when you'll need it);</li><li>Look nice from a small size to really big one (I asked for a vector, but sometimes even if the quality is there, if it's too small, you lose the design).</li></ul><p>So from now on, you'll see that cute little gnome a bit everywhere. I hope you like it as much as I do, but in any cases, for sure, you'll associate it with me...</p>
