A little less than one month ago, I was <a title="Mobile Startups Toronto, and Firefox OS as an opportunity" href="http://fred.dev/mobile-startups-toronto-and-firefox-os-as-an-opportunity/">writing about a presentation on Firefox OS I'll do at Mobile Startups Toronto in January</a>. It went fast as the event is already in two days...

Since, <a title="HTML5 Toronto website" href="http://htmltoronto.ca/">HTML5 Toronto</a> as join to co-host the event with the nice folks at <a title="Mobile Startups Toronto website" href="https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startup-TO/">Mobile Startups Toronto</a>. They'll also <a title="YouTube link for streaming event" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHWGeeIwBcY">stream the event live</a> for people who can't assist in person. So if you are free, and in Toronto, come join us this Wednesday at 18:45 at the <a title="Mozilla Toronto Community Space" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/toronto/">Mozilla Community Space</a> (366 Adelaide St. W, Suite 500), and don't forget to register first, either at the <a title="Mobile Startups Toronto registration page" href="https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startups-TO/events/152828322/">Mobile Startups Toronto meetup page</a> or on the <a title="HTML5 Toronto registration page" href="https://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Web-App-Developers/events/155519012/">HTML5 Toronto one</a>. Whether I'm presenting or wants to watch a presentation, I always prefer to go in-person: the experience is never the same, and&nbsp;the networking part is a huge plus, so I highly encourage you to do the same. For those of you that aren't in Toronto, or even in Canada, but are still available at that time, you'll be able to watch the session by <a title="YouTube link for streaming event" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHWGeeIwBcY">joining the live event</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HTML5Toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel of HTML5 Toronto</a>. Keep in mind that the video will also be available on their channel soon after the event.

Yesterday, <a title="Matthew Potter's Twitter account" href="https://twitter.com/AskMP">Matthew Potter</a>,&nbsp;the mastermind behind the HTML5 Toronto user group, did an #StreamingSunday live interview with me.

I hope to see you in Toronto Wednesday evening, but if you can't join, but would like to meet, let me know.
