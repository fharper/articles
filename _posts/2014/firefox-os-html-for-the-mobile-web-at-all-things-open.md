Every time I speak at a conference, I feel bless to be able to do so. For me, it's a great opportunity to share my passion as expertise about technology. For <a title="All Things Open Website" href="https://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a>, I was happy to be part of the amazing list of speakers who love Open Source as much as I do. As for many of the talks I did in the last one year, and a half, I was talking about Firefox OS. I think that there is still a lot of awareness to create about this new operating system: so many people don't know about the power behind Firefox OS and HTML5. It's even truer about North America as you cannot go to your local store, and buy a device like you can in some places in Europe, and LATAM.

Since I was in the main room, my talk was recorded. Also, because of that, and that five tracks were available at the same time, my room looks a bit empty (I had about 100 people). In any cases, I got interesting feedbacks about Firefox OS and my talk.

As a habit, I started my recording process, so you have access to another version. The sound is not as good as a professional recording, but you have a better view on the screen (I should mix the two to make the ultimate recording).

Looking forward to speaking at the 2016 edition of ATO!
