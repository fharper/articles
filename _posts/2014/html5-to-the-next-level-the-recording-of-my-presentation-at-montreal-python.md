Last month [I spoke at the monthly Python Montréal meetup][1] about, guess what, Firefox OS. I already [uploaded the slides online][2], and now the recording of my talk. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f14e5iQDAYY Thanks again to the friend [Christian Aubry][3], who, like always, did an amazing job with the recording. Thanks also to [Python Montréal][4] for having me and Google Montréal for sponsoring the event.
