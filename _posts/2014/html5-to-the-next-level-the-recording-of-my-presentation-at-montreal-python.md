Last month <a title="HTML5 to the next level with Firefox OS at Python Montreal" href="http://fred.dev/html5-to-the-next-level-with-firefox-os-at-python-montreal/">I spoke at the monthly Python Montréal meetup</a> about, guess what, Firefox OS. I already <a title="Firefox OS love in the Python world" href="http://fred.dev/firefox-os-love-in-the-python-world/">uploaded the slides online</a>, and now the recording of my talk.

Thanks again to the friend <a title="Christian Aubry Twitter account" href="https://twitter.com/christianaubry">Christian Aubry</a>, who, like always, did an amazing job with the recording. Thanks also to <a title="Python Montréal" href="https://montrealpython.org/en/">Python Montréal</a> for having me and Google Montréal for sponsoring the event.
