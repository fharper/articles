Yesterday, I had the pleasure to do a talk at the [Herzing College][1], the school I went to. They allocated me one hour with the students, so I decided to split my time in two parts. Firstly, I did a talk on how to get out of the crowd for the first thirty minutes. The remaining time was dedicated to questions. I thought it was a good opportunity for them to ask anything about the industry from someone who graduate twelve years ago, from the same place. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to record my talk due to their class' setting, but here are the slides: https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper/get-out-of-the-crowd-herzing-college-20140424 As you can see, my goal was simple: help them to find insights on how to differentiate themselves from others. In the end, they'll all graduate with the same diploma, same education, same experience, and same homework assignments. How, as an employer, receiving many resumes for one job, can I put their name on top of the list? In other words, it was a quick introduction to the concept of [personal branding][2] as it's the perfect time for them to start thinking about it.
