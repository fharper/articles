Yesterday, I was in Toronto to share some Firefox OS love with my Canadian friends. I was invited to speak at a joint meetup with [Mobile Startups Toronto][1], and [HTML Toronto][2]. The demo god wasn't with me as mostly everything went wrong at the beginning, but fortunately, the rest of the presentation has been great, and I was surprised but the number, and the quality of the questions.

As usual, here are my slides:

Thanks to [Matthew Potter][3], my presentation has been recorded.

It's always a pleasure to come in Toronto, and even more to talk about this amazing OS. Remember, if you build a Firefox OS application or plan to port an actual web application to this platform, [please let me know][5].
