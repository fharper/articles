At the last day of October, I'll be in Montevideo in Uruguay at the MOVE event from [Movistar][1]. I'll give a high-level talk about Firefox OS, and Mozilla vision for the future of the web. My talk will be in English, but I'm pretty sure that most of the other ones will be in Spanish. If you are local, feel free to join us by requesting a free accreditation as the space is limited. All the event will also be streamed online if you can't make it onsite. I'm looking forward to sharing some Firefox OS love in Montevideo, and to visit the city on my first trip to Uruguay: if you have any suggestions of what to do, to see, or to eat, let me know.
