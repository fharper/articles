<figure><img alt="cheesecakeninja" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cheesecakeninja.png" width="600" height="328"/></figure><p>Everywhere I go I like to take pictures of beautiful <a title="Street Art posts" href="https://fred.dev/tag/street-art/">street art</a>, but there is another form of street art that I like: street music. All those musicians, sometimes very good, other time, not that much, are part of discovering a new city. It's not just about travelling as we have a lot of those musicians in Montreal playing in downtown streets during the summer, or even in the subway.</p><p>I found this video that I took in Montréal four years ago. The <a title="Cheesecake Ninja website" href="https://www.cheesecakeninja.com/">cheesecake ninja</a> (this band name is awesome) is playing since forever in the streets of Montréal, and I always have a great time when I pass near them, so I even bought their albums. I like their beat, it put a smile on your face, and give you the will to do anything!</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJL_SfSUQfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>If you enjoyed as much as I do, share the love, and buy their albums online.</p>
