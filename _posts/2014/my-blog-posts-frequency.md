I've been blogging daily since a couple of months now, but eleven days ago, I stopped. It wasn't intentional as I had no shortage of post ideas: I still have more than one hundred fifty drafts waiting for me. It was a time constraint: [I didn't prioritize][1] blogging while I was at my team Paris work week. I'm not writing this to justify myself, as, after all, it's my blog. That little break taught me two things. First thing: none of my readers complains about my lack of posts for the last couple of days. At some level, I'm fine with it as I'm blogging for myself first, but it makes me think that my quality level, maybe, wasn't there as people were not missing them. Since one of [my three words for the year][2] is quality, that make me rethink my blogging cadence, and strategy. Second thing is more personal. I realized that, when I was writing a series of posts to schedule them on days I know I wouldn't be able to write, it was more of a task than a pleasure. Don't get me wrong, I like to write a lot, but I prefer to take my time, and go with my ideas' flow. In the end, my goal for life is to enjoy every moment of it! What does that mean for you? Expect fewer posts, but I hope, more quality ones.
