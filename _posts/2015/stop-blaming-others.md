It's others fault if I can't do what I want to do today. It's because of him I cannot get the job I want. If it weren't for her, I would be able to get to bed earlier. Ever said something like this? I did. It's the inner you, finding reasons on why you failed at your goal as small or big they were.

I'm a big believer in the fact that we all manage our life. When we blame others for what happened to us, we just <a title="you have no excuses: just do it!" href="http://fred.dev/you-have-no-excuses-just-do-it/">find excuses</a> to feel better. We don't face reality, and the unpleasant feeling that it was our fault. If you think about it and be honest, really honest with yourself, there aren't many situations where it was really out of your control. Quite often it's because we don't want to deal with the consequences of our choices, and face the reality: it's easier to blame others. You didn't want to help your friend to move to a new apartment, but you didn't had the choice? You mean, you didn't want to help your friend move to a new apartment, and you didn't want to deal with the consequences if you didn't help her or him? Nobody put a gun on your head to force you to do it. You were the master of your decision, no?

I'm not sure where this habit comes from, but it's a bad one we need to get rid off. We need to take the ownership of our life, stop blaming others and be accountable for the decision we make... or don't make...
