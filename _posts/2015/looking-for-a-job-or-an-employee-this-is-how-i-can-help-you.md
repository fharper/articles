There is no secret there: the love of the tech community is one of the reasons I can consider myself successful today. Recognizing that, I try to give back as much as I can. One of my pleasure is to use trust, reputation, and relationships to be a <a title="The book Trust Agents: Using the Web to Build Influence, Improve Reputation, and Earn Trust by Julien Smith and Chris Brogan" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Trust-Agents-Influence-Improve-Reputation-ebook/dp/B003VWCQBK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust agent</a>. Part of it is about helping others to find a job or a new employee. Since I get a lot of requests, here is how you can help me... helping you.
<h2>Looking for a job or a contract?</h2>
There are two things I can do for you: putting you directly in contact with a company looking to hire someone with your expertise or sharing your profile within my network. In any cases, I'll need your LinkedIn profile. I'll also need you to give me a short, but clear description of what you are looking for, anything not being a good answer. Are you looking for a full-time or part-time job? Do you prefer to be a contractor and when will you be available? Which programming languages did you use or would like to use? I can't stress enough on the cleanest, and short length (hint: Twitter) of the information you'll give me.

Once you have that information, <a title="Send me an email" href="mailto:fharper@oocz.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send me an email</a>, and I'll see if I can help.
<h2>Looking for an employee?</h2>
First, if you are a professional recruiter or have any inside of your company, this offer is not for you. I want to help, but not by doing someone's else job. On top of that, they will be a lot better than me at finding the perfect candidate for you.

If you want my help to be more impactful, put your offer somewhere online. It can be on LinkedIn, on your site, or on a Github gist, I don't care. You'll have more chances to find good candidates if there is a URL where they can find some information about the role you are offering. Be clear on what you are looking for this open role: you are competing with companies all over the world with remote working policies. You are also competing not just on salary, but cool projects, startups, great benefits, and more, so show to your future employee why they would choose you instead of another business. There are plenty of jobs out there, and not enough good developers! Once you get something online, feel free <a title="Send me an email" href="mailto:fharper@oocz.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to email me</a>.

Keep in mind that there is no guarantee it will help! Even if this is something I like to do, it's also time-consuming. I want both of us to make the best use of our time, so please keep these requirements in mind before contacting me: you'll get more chance to reach your goal.
