Two weeks ago, I received a copy of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=outofcomzon-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=212553&amp;creative=381305&amp;creativeASIN=1118008189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML &amp; CSS, design and build websites</a>. I didn't have the time to read it yet, but at the first look it seems to be the most beautiful book I saw on this topic: really nice design and graphics. Hey, why technical book needs to be visually boring?

Thanks to Jon Duckett, the author, for the free copy
