![][1]Two weeks ago, my friend <a href="https://joeydevilla.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey DeVilla</a> was in town. We planned some time to catch up, and went to a local bistro.

I know the video is shaking a lot, but it's not bad considering it was taken with my phone, by walking backwards on the sidewalk... Funny story, at some point we heard <a href="https://www.gypsybandito.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CT Moore</a> yelling at us from his new apartment. How many time to do hear an accordion player in your street, singing French son like "Bye bye mon cowboy" with an English accent? He had no reason to think it was not Joey!

*P.S.: Yes I know, the title, with the main picture can be confusing...*
