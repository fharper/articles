<img title="WP_000168" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/WP_000168.jpg" alt=""/>Two weeks ago, my friend <a href="https://joeydevilla.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey DeVilla</a> was in town. We planned some time to catch up, and went to a local bistro. As usual Joey had his accordion, but this time it was to give <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilieJolie">Émilie</a the opportunity to try it (as you can see on the picture). Right after her attempt of getting some noise from it (I tease her, as I know it's really hard), Joey started to play some of his favorite songs during our walk to the restaurant. Joey always made a hit with his accordion, and it was not different this time, as everybody on our road were smiling.<p style="text-align:center"><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVXIrzMR0bA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p style="text-align:center"><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcBvtHK09nY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p>I know the video is shaking a lot, but it's not bad considering it was taken with my phone, by walking backwards on the sidewalk... Funny story, at some point we heard <a href="https://www.gypsybandito.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CT Moore</a> yelling at us from his new apartment. How many time to do hear an accordion player in your street, singing French son like "Bye bye mon cowboy" with an English accent? He had no reason to think it was not Joey!</p><em>P.S.: Yes I know, the title, with the main picture can be confusing...</em>
