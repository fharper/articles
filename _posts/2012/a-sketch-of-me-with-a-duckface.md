Samsung has a drawer at <a href="https://www.fitc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FITC</a>, so between sessions he did a sketch of me, that I need to say, is just awesome. I really like it, even if he gave me a duckface!</p><p>For those of you that want to see Seth Wilks’ works, you can go <a href="https://sethwilks.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to his website</a>.</p>
