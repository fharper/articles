You are busy. We are busy. Everybody is busy. Maybe too much?</p><p>It's <a href="https://www.mathieuchartier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathieu Chartier</a>, at the last <a href="https://html5mtl.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML5mtl</a> meetup, who made me aware of this: everybody is always busy, and it's like a contest of who has been the busiest! We can say that this is the world we are living in today, but I don't find it's something normal. It's also not normal that being busy is part of our answer when someone asks us how are we doing...</p><p style="padding-left:30px">"How are you?"</p><p style="padding-left:30px">"I'm busy. I didn't have a day off for the last four weeks" or "Not so bad, but very busy. I didn't see my girlfriend for the last two weeks".</p><p>This ascertainment from Mathieu worried me a lot, because I'm this kind of person. The kind of person who is busy, too busy. The kind of person who do too much stuff so at the end, there are some direct repercussion of his life like:</p><ul><li>No time to relax;</li><li>Neglecting friends or family;</li><li>No time for other hobbies;</li><li>Just no time to take a moment to enjoy the life.</li></ul><p>No worries here, I'm not doing a depression, but I just think we need to take more time for us, to relax, to enjoy the life. Be careful, as I'm not just talking about work. There are many ways to make our life busy: of course too much work, but there are also volunteers, personal projects, others projects... On top of that, when we are too busy, we are starting to deliver poor results on what keeps us busy.</p><p>I'm 30, and since I'm 17, I did a lot of things in addition of my job: volunteer in <a href="https://www.scoutsmm.qc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scouting </a>for 11 years with multiple roles at the same time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1F7D712040EC8DEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video podcast</a>, <a href="https://wearegeek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audio podcast</a>, started a <a href="https://html5mtl.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usergroup</a>, volunteer in a <a href="https://w3qc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">association</a>, created a <a href="https://geekfestmtl.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geek festival</a>, and more! Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but I'm feeling that I need to slow down, get more time for me, for my family, my friends, to relax, and do some little project (I cannot live without any projects - It's my entrepreneurial side, taking an idea, and making it a reality is my drug), that doesn't involve timelines and/or others (in other words, no obligations). Of course, dedicating myself to the job I like by having a <a href="https://fred.dev/work-hard-play-hard/">good work, and life balance</a> is part of this. <strong>Do you think we are too busy? Are you too busy? Do we need more time to relax, and enjoy the life? Share your thoughts!</strong></p>
