<img title="11" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/111.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="719"/>Since I have joined the team at Microsoft Canada, there is a running gag about <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/damirb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damir</a> being my dad: you have to admit that the resemblance is troubling. A couple of months ago, I made a t-shirt for myself saying that Damir is not my father. On the last <a href="https://techdays.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechDays </a>tour, I thoughts that it could be fun to have a t-shirt for Damir too. The result was awesome as everybody that know both of us laugh a good time. As I was always looking for this picture to show both of us, I thought that a blog post would be good. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/RyanStorgaard">Ryan</a for taking this memorable picture...
