  Two days ago, I wrote about the project of <a href="https://fabricecalando.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabrice Calando</a>, <a href="https://fred.dev/hack-your-life/">Hack your life</a>. Since I think it’s an amazing idea, I wanted to participate, and it’s what I did with the first challenge: <a href="https://fabricecalando.com/hack-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get rid of excess clothing</a>.

To be honest with you, it wasn’t a hard challenge for me, and it’s OK. I really think that the challenges will sometime be easy and sometimes harder depends on a lot of personal factors. Once in 2-3 months, I clean my wardrobe, and give to charity the clothes that I don’t want anymore. I must say that I had a couple of conferences, and Geek t-shirts that I was holding for memory purpose. Some of them are also real art! This clean up gave me the idea to post, on this blog, some of the t-shirts I have. People always tell me that my t-shirts are awesome, so why can I share some Geek fashion here!

I did this challenge with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/EmilieJolie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my fiancé</a>, so the three big bags are not only my stuffs. We also take the time to give other things we didn’t use anymore to the local <a href="https://www.renaissancequebec.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fripe-Prix Renaissance</a>. I encourage you to do the same with things you want to get rid off that are still usable.

**Did you do this challenge? If not, will you do it? If yes, was it easy or hard for you? Share your thoughts!**
