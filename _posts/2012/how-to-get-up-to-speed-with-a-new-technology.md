Whether you are a professional, a student or a hobbyist, learning a technology is sometimes a challenge. Where to start? In this blog post, I will give you my tips around getting up to speed with a new technology.</p><strong>Before your start</strong><p>If you are not limited to a specific technology, like someone who has to learn the next programming language for their work, you may ask yourself, which one fit the best my needs. A good way to see what the industry is using or what is the thoughts about this new HTML5 thing you saw on the Web last day, online community is the best place to start. I go often to a place call <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>. It’s really a good place for technical and sometimes, more high level discussion/questions. You can also go to places like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3398140&amp;trk=hb_side_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p><strong>I know which programming language I want to learn</strong><p>Now you know what you want to learn. Personaly, I’m still a fan of book, or in a digital world, eBook. You can buy great books on site like <a href="https://amazon.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> or directly from the publisher like <a href="https://oreilly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O’reilly</a> or <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/category/microsoft-press.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Press</a>. You can also go on a site like the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/cdndevs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSDN blog</a> to find great resources. If you are ready to invest some money, you can use website like <a href="https://www.lynda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynda.com</a> that gives you a lot of tutorial for a monthly fee. Furthermore, never underestimate good music for the learning process!</p><strong>I want to go further</strong><p>If you want to learn more, you can also go to conference or users group. There are so many conferences about technology that you have plenty of choices. Just in the top of my head for the next month, I can suggest you <a href="https://www.prairiedevcon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrairieDevCon</a> for Calgary people, <a href="https://confoo.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confoo</a> for Montreal people or <a href="https://webaquebec.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Web à Québec</a> for French people. OK, I know more conferences from Quebec since I’m living there, but search the Web, and you will find a lot more. Don’t forget user groups: there are so many that offer top quality presentation for free or a minimal fee. Here is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/aa497440.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a list</a> to start.</p><strong>Prove your knowledge</strong><p>What happening after I learn the technology? For sure, you will use it for the project or the work you had in mind, but there are more ways to test your competencies. You can take a certification exam or participate in some competitions, hackfests or even take advantage of things like the <a href="https://www.developermovement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Movement</a>. A great way to build your next idea, have some fun, be creative, win some prize and for sure, validate your learning process.</p><strong>It’s not a big step by step process, but these are my tricks to get up to speed with a new technology, what are yours? How do you start the learning process?</strong><div id="cross-post">This blog post also appears in the <a href="https://w00t.ms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w00t blog</a></div>
