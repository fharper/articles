I’m a bit late to post my results on the <a href="https://fabricecalando.com/hack-your-life-project-hello-stranger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenge #3</a> of the Hack Your Life project from <a href="https://fabricecalando.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabrice Calando</a>, since the <a href="https://fabricecalando.com/hack-your-life-project-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4th one</a> just finish. The challenge was about speaking to a stranger. Not someone like the barista, the delivery boy or the bus driver, someone who you really don’t know.

No need to say that with my job, talking to a stranger is not a big deal: I do this all the time: sometimes on a 1 on 1 formula, sometimes to a couple of thousands. Even if it wasn’t a challenge for me, I think that it’s a very important one for people that aren’t comfortable with this. All your life you’ll have to talk to people you don’t know or worst, people you are afraid to talk to. It’s the first step to a better life, I can tell you.

<span style="color:#333">I must say that Ia couple of years ago, maybe 12 years from now, I was a shy guy. I know it’s hard to believe when you know me, but it’s a true story. At one point, I understood that being shy wouldn’t help me in life: I was losing a lot of opportunities. Now you will say that I went too much on the other side, but trust me, it worth it. Speaking to a stranger is a good way to start to leave the shy part of yourself behind you.</span>**Did you do the challenge? If not, it is never too late. Was it easy for you or a hard one? Are you a shy person? Share your thoughts.**
