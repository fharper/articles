![][1]Usually, when I'm doing a blog post, I'm searching on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=&l=comm&ss=2&ct=6&mt=photos&w=all&adv=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr for a picture or image with a Creative Commons license</a>. So last week, I was looking for one to put into my blog post around HTML5 resources and I saw this one: a *sexy* (sexy?) picture of <a href="https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Lawson</a>, one of the two authors of a HTML5 book. One month ago, [I found the picture][2] of [Remy Sharp</a, the other author.
I wonder if it's these pictures that motivated <a href="https://bristowe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bristowe</a> to buy this book a couple of months ago for the team... By the way, you can buy their book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321784421/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=outofcomzon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=0321784421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to HTML5 second edition</a>.][3]
