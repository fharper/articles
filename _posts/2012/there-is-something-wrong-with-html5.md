So last week, I was looking for one to put into my blog post around HTML5 resources and I saw this one: a <em>sexy</em> (sexy?) picture of <a href="https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Lawson</a>, one of the two authors of a HTML5 book. One month ago, <a title="Scary HTML5 book promotion" href="https://fred.dev/scary-html5-book-promotion/">I found the picture</a> of <a href="https://remysharp.com/">Remy Sharp</a, the other author.<p>I wonder if it's these pictures that motivated <a href="https://bristowe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bristowe</a> to buy this book a couple of months ago for the team... By the way, you can buy their book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321784421/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=outofcomzon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0321784421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to HTML5 second edition</a>.</p>
