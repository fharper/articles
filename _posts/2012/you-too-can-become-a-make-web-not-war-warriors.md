On March 8th, we will have a full day of free webinars just for you. A good way to learn new technology presented by experts. A great opportunity to learn about Web, mobile, design, cloud computing and more…

As we know that not everybody has an interest in all topics, and that it’s not always easy to take a full day of training, we give you the opportunity to register to each presentation separately. For those of you that want to maximize their days, we wanted to be sure that you have some time left between each session to go grab a coffee, read your e-mails, take a snack or tweet about the awesome session you saw!

Here is the amazing schedule we made for you:

11:00 – 11:45am - **Designing Mobile Apps that Don’t Suck**- Paul Laberge

Over the past 3-4 years, mobile apps have moved from a niche market for a select few developers and designers to a massive new economy across multiple platforms. Gone are the days where a mobile application is seen as an afterthought; it’s simply not enough for a mobile platform to be “good at email”. While this is true and there are apps that cover almost every imaginable task, its arguable that the majority of those apps are poorly designed and could use significant improvement to their user experience. In this session, we’ll show you what you as a mobile app developer/designer should be thinking about when building your app, regardless of the mobile platform you are targeting. We will go through a great number of topics including how to standardize the look and feel of your app to the platform, creating an effective and appealing user interface, implementing your idea for the mobile form factor and more.

12:00 – 12:45pm - **Take the red pill and enter the Matrix**- Frédéric Harper

Don't fear the Agents anymore. In this presentation, we'll show you how it's easy to build a Website with the right tools. Including a Web server, a database, a SEO reporting tool and much more, WebMatrix, a free IDE, give you anything you need to be as fast as Neo. Coding in PHP or HTML5 has never been so easy. You work with Wordpress, DotNetNuke, Joomla or Umbraco? Don't worries, you'll be up and running with these (and more!) in less than five minutes. If you don't want to control the Matrix, you can always take the blue pill...

1:00 – 1:45pm - **Winning on Mobile Marketplaces: Strategies for your Mobile Apps to Gain Traction**- Paul Laberge

If you are a modern mobile developer then you already likely already know that it’s tough to gain traction in a crowded, central Marketplace. In this session, we go through strategies for distributing your app and game both publicly and privately. You can use these strategies to help market your app or game and give you some ideas for addressing how you can convince users not only to download your app, but also to keep opening it and using it over your competition.

2:00 – 2:45pm - **Responsive Web Design: The View of the World Depends on the Glasses I Wear**- Thomas Lewis

There is no mobile Web, there is no desktop Web, and there is no tablet Web. We view the same Web just in different ways. So how do we do it? By getting rid of our fixed-width, device-specific approaches and use Responsive Web Design techniques. This session will focus on what is Responsive Web Design and how you can use its 3-pronged approach on your current apps today which will also adapt for new devices in the future.

3:00 – 3:45pm - **What’s That “Cloud” Thing?**– Jonathan Rozenblit

The Cloud is like the new “HD”. Everywhere you go these days, there’s something about the Cloud or someone is talking about it. So what’s hype all about? Why do your applications need it? Tune in to find out. You’ll see how your existing apps can go to a whole new level and how your new apps, whether they’re on the web, on the desktop, or on devices roaming the world, can go from being awesome to being epic.

4:00 – 4:45pm - **Devices, Your App, and the Cloud**- Atley Hunter

There are extremely few popular device apps that do not connect to some kind of web-based or cloud service. Today’s apps are connected experiences and derive a great deal of value through the content they consume from services. See, through an end-to-end development experience, how connecting your Windows Phone, iOS, and/or Android device apps to the Cloud opens up a world of interesting possibilities.
