It makes sense if you find the item too expensive? It also makes sense if you find that the company or the entire industry make too much money. No?</p><p>It’s been a while since I’m thinking about writing this blog post. I’m tired of people who tell me that I should watch movies for free because it cost me too much since I watch a lot of them. I’m tired of people who tell me that I should find a torrent file to get my hand on this expensive software that I will use only once in a while. I’m tired of people that tell me I’m stupid to buy my music as I would be able to get the albums for free on the Internet.</p><p>If I cannot afford something, I don’t buy it. If I feel that I’m spending too much because I consume a lot, I put a limit, and minimize my expenses. If you steal something, no matter the reason, you are a thief. For me, there is no different with the person who go to a physical store to steal something, and the person who downloads a movie, a song, a software or whatever that it should have bought.</p><p>So next time you suggest to someone to pirate something or do it yourself, please go to a store, and steal something physical. After this, you’ll earn the right to tell us this…</p>
