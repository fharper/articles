Here is another interview I did for my [never born project][2], <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130628080719/http://www.webnotwar.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make Web Not War</a> TV, at the <a href="https://webaquebec.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web à Québec</a> (website in French). I had the pleasure, on the first evening of the event, to interview <a href="http://kruzeniski.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Kruzeniski</a>, Design Lead at Twitter, who was a colleague before as a Principal Design Lead on the Windows Phone team at Microsoft. We talked about Modern UI (used to be call Metro UI), content before chrome, tips for developers who wants to make a good design, and more.

Are you a designer, or a developer? Do you like great design? Any good example? Any tips for people like me who suck at design? Share your thoughts.
