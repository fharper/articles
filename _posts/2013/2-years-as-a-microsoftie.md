On the last day of 2012, it has been 2 years that I'm a Microsoftie (internal name for a Microsoft employee). As things are related for now, it has also been two years that I'm being paid to do what I like to do for a living, Evangelism!

Time goes quickly as I feel like it was yesterday that I've become a blue badge (another way of talking about a full time employee at Microsoft). A lot of things have changed since [last year][1]:

*   The Evangelism job has changed at Microsoft Canada, and I still need to adapt;
*   A member of my v-team, <a href="https://twitter.com/InteropQueen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia </a>got pregnant, and <a href="https://keithloo.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith </a>took her role;
*   We changed a little bit the focus of my primary audience;
*   I started the year with a new partner in crime, <a href="https://reemah.posterous.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reemah</a>, as my first one, <a href="https://twitter.com/sammwong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samantha</a>, got a new role. Half-way during the year, I changed again for <a href="https://twitter.com/VanBees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa </a>(hey, all "a" names), as Reemah also got a new role (maybe I scared them - I'm curios to see how much time Vanessa will tough me);
*   The 3 products I'm focussing on had new releases: Windows, Windows Phone, and Windows Azure;
*   Two team members, my [unknown father][2] <a href="https://twitter.com/DamirB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damir</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/RicksterCDN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick</a>, changed roles inside of Microsoft (yes there is always a lot of movement between roles at Microsoft), and another one, <a href="https://ruthlindamorton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruth</a>, left the company;
*   Two new members, <a href="https://www.gotsomething.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc</a>, and <a href="https://roman.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierre</a>, join the family (my direct team);
*   ...

I also learn a lot of new stuff during this crazy year:

*   There are people who I don't want to waste time anymore with (I have no problem with the fact you don't like us or our products, but I have one with the fact you can't have a discussion);
*   It's a good time to be at Microsoft with products like Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows Azure;
*   I can handle crazy period of the years, but not for many weeks straight without taking time for me;
*   The things I'm enjoying the most in this role are: networking, public speaking, travelling, helping, and sharing with others;
*   I miss coding, as I feel I didn't code enough since I stop being a freelancer;
*   ...

It has been a great year, and I'm looking forward to an even better one.

*P.S.: I like this picture. Can you guess what I was saying to the attendees of <a href="https://mtldgtl.com/en/mobiz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobiz</a>? OK I don't remember it, but it's funny what people said when they saw this picture on Facebook.*
