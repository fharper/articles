[<img alt="Whatfoxsays-Fred" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Whatfoxsays-Fred.jpg" width="600" height="452" />][1] What does the fox say? Yesterday evening, at the Mozilla Summit Party in Brussels (Belgium), <a href="https://t.co/HnxcHGg9uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Fabbro</a>, another Technical Evangelist on my team, had this amazing hat (can I call this a hat?!), and I really wanted to try it. I did, and she took a picture of me. I really like it; it will be my new avatar! The web being the web, the "friend" <a href="https://blog.guybarrette.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Barrette</a> made a meme with it. So funny, thanks Guy :)
P.S.: I really need to find a cool Firefox hat (or something else) related to Firefox, I could wear. You know I don't like to be like others (I guess it's part of my extrovert personality), and I have no problem to be the one you notice (or point out to) in the room!
