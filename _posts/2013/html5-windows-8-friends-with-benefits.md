The event was a mix of installfest, hackathon, and some presentations. I started the day with an introduction to Windows 8, and how to build amazing applications with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As I like to scale online with in-person events, I was happy to see that <a href="https://twitter.com/AskMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Potter</a> was streaming the event online, and kept a copy for on-demand viewing. Let's start this Monday with some Windows 8 love with my always sexy English accent!</p><p style="text-align:center"><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37Kb87QyKR4?start=334&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p style="text-align:left"><em>P.S.: I like this picture so much, thanks Chow Productions Inc.</em></p>
