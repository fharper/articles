As I did with my first visit in Seattle, and the [one in Krakow][2], I'm asking my friends, and network what to do. Unfortunately, I didn't have as much time as I wanted in Krakow (I had to work since [my week before wasn't very productive][3]), and didn't plan anything specific when I was [in San Jose last week][4], but trust me, I'm taking two days off in Brussels to visit this beautiful city.

I know Belgium is the place for food as I have on a list some specific things I want to taste: French fries, chocolate, waffle, and some tasty local beers that we don't have the chance to drink here. For sure, I'll need to do a lot more exercise during this trip as it won't be good for the belly! If you ever went in Brussels, any places I should not miss? Any restaurant I really need to try? Any specific beer I should drink? Any museum I should buy a ticket for? I may have some time during the <a href="https://summit.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Summit</a> to visit a little, but I prefer to plan for the nearly two days I'll have off there. I'll also do my own research, but I consistently like to ask my network too, and build on top of others experience. Of course, I'll try to do at least <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=fharper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one or two geocaches there</a>, and just walk in the town, without any specific destination: it's always a good way to find less-known area.

Again, I'm very lucky to have the latitude to do this with my job, but trust me; my employer doesn't loose on this. Before I forget, if you have any suggestion when it comes to cellphone data providers while I'm there, I'll need to buy a sim card: I can't live without data! So anything I should do? Any good or bad experience you had there? Any recommendations? Share your thoughts!
