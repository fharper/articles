When my doctor told me I should drink less coffee, I had to find a replacement somehow, and I now like to drink tea (without caffeine) once in a while. I'm tired of having the choice between "English Breakfast" or the other <em>irresistible</em> camomile, so I bought a little kit I can bring with me when I'm traveling. Thanks to <a href="https://wirelesslyobsessed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Bartolo</a> for recording this... I hate you with love Bartolo!</p><p style="text-align:center"><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2LIsuFQzgg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p>P.S.: Yeah, I'm expecting many people calling me Tea Princess in addition to my co-workers that were at the table with me at that time!</p>
