I did the first technical talk of the day, and my goal was to excited developers about the platform, and to show them all the possibilities they have for building their application. I was quite impressed by the dedication of developers during all the hackathon: they were hard at work to get a chance to win one of the amazing prizes we had!</p><div class="embed rich SlideShare"><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/aP03NVncCfnbiS" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px;margin-bottom:5px;max-width:100%" allowfullscreen> </iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper/firefox-os-the-platform-you-deserve-athens-app-days-20131127" title="Firefox OS - The platform you deserve - Athens App Days - 2013-11-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox OS - The platform you deserve - Athens App Days - 2013-11-27</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frédéric Harper</a></strong></div></div><p>As usual, there is also a recording of my presentation.</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxuZRrrsQlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxuZRrrsQlM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox OS - the platform you deserve on YouTube</a><p>I hope you enjoyed the presentation, and let me know if you still need help with the development of your Firefox OS app: I can't wait to see them in the marketplace!
