<img src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/keepbrowseon.png" alt="keepbrowseon" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12013"/><p>There are so many parodies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keep calm, and carry on poster used in the Second World War</a>, and even if most of them are shitty, once in a while, I found a good one. A couple of weeks ago, the friend <a href="https://christianheilmann.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Heilmann</a> tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/362254737078366208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about one</a> from the Mozilla assets: <a href="https://assets.mozillalabs.com/Graphics/Wallpapers/BrowseOn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keep calm, and browse on</a>. I thought it was brilliant, but I didn't like the gradient background. I tried to find a vector version, but wasn't able to find one, so my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/ValerieDore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valérie Doré</a>, made one just for me! She found the vector version of the Firefox logo, download the usual font used for this poster, and made two SVG versions: <a href="https://fred.dev/images/2013/08/firefoxkeep.svg">one like the original asset</a>, and <a href="https://fred.dev/images/2013/08/firefoxkeepFullcircle.svg">another one with a full circle</a> (shown above). I now used it as my background, and plan to use it elsewhere. Thanks to Val for this amazing work, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ValerieDore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel free to let her know about your appreciation of her work</a> if you used it (or not).</p>
