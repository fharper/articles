Last year [I took some specific resolutions][1], and 4 days ago, I did a [quick review of my last year][2]. The bottom line was that, having resolutions is not a bad idea, but it's not the perfect scenarios. It's been 2-3 years now that I'm seeing people like <a href="https://www.chrisbrogan.com/my-3-words-for-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brogan</a>, <a href="https://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/my-3-words-for-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitch Joel</a>, <a href="https://www.cc-chapman.com/2013/menu-build-minimize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC Chapman</a>, <a href="https://www.christopherspenn.com/2012/12/3-words-for-2012-3-words-for-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher S. Penn</a>, and even the friend <a href="https://fabricecalando.com/3-words-for-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabrice Calando</a> do the "3 words for next year", instead of classic resolutions. Always by keeping in mind [my life manifesto][3], that is still of actually, I have the feeling that it will be an amazing way to help me shape what will be 2013 for me. 
## Kaizen

[It's not the first time I'm using this word][4] as a mantra. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaizen </a>is a Japanese word for improvement, a philosophy that focuses upon continuous improvement of processes mostly in business. I'm a big fan of improving every part of my life: whether it's around my work, or my personal life, I always try to do more with less, and do better as before. I think Kaizen summarize in a beautiful way one of my goals for next year: be better. 
## Time I have a love-hate relationship with time. I have the feeling that for the last 14 years, I've been running. I'm using all my time to work, volunteer, create... Don't get me wrong, I'm a man of action, I like to do stuff. I like to create stuff. I like to make things happen! I just think I'm a bit tired of always having something to do. You know that feeling when you relax or do something non-productive, and you just feel bad as you would be able to use that time for something 

*better*. I will continue to create, but it will be for me, only for me. It will also be at my pace, without any deadlines (except at work, of course). This year, I'll take the time. [I'll take the time to live][5]... 
## Discovery You know those brats who always ask why? I was that type of kid. Why (you see!)? Because I like to know, I love to learn, and I have the need to discover new stuff. Whether it's a new passion, a restaurant I never had the chance to go, or a city way beyond the last place I traveled to, I want to discover. For me, it's more than learning, so it's why I choose discovery. Let's see where this will take me for the next 358 days (yeah, I wrote this post one week after the beginning of the year!).  I'm looking at these three words - Kaizen, Time & Discovery -, and I feel great. If I can keep these words in mind during the next year, I'm pretty sure that my last blog post (or the first one) will be about how amazing 2013 was for me. 

**I cannot wish you anything other than an awesome year too! On your side, did you take New Year’s resolutions? Will you try the 3 words trick? Share your thoughts!** <p style="text-align: center;">
