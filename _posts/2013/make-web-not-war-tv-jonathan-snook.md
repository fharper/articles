![Snook_and_Fred][1]Part of the series of interviews I did for [the project I had, a Make Web Not War TV][2], I also had the pleasure to talk with <a href="https://snook.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Snook</a>, at the <a href="https://webaquebec.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web à Québec</a> (they had an interesting line-up of international speakers). Of course, we talked about CSS, HTML, his book [SMACSS][3]<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WoJFewCRH1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Do you enjoy new CSS features? Did you read Jonathan's book? Do you have any best practices for CSS? Share your thoughts.

*P.S.: I try not to publish posts in the same series consecutively, but I'm in Toronto for a team offsite, and didn't have the time to write a more complete post for today.*
