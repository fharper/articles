Of course, we talked about CSS, HTML, his book <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a (Scalable, and Modular Architecture for CSS), best practices, and more.<div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WoJFewCRH1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Do you enjoy new CSS features? Did you read Jonathan's book? Do you have any best practices for CSS? Share your thoughts.</p><em>P.S.: I try not to publish posts in the same series consecutively, but I'm in Toronto for a team offsite, and didn't have the time to write a more complete post for today.</em>
