I don't know about you, but I found this fake ad so hilarious, and at the same time, so sad as it's really true for Canadians! It makes me think about the project triangle, choose two of these three elements: quality, cost &amp; time. For our Internet provider, it's usually the same thing, you have the choice between two of these three elements: speed, reliability &amp; cost. On my side, I'm pretty happy with Videotron on the cost, and reliability sides, but I'm paying way too much for what I have... Thanks to <a href="https://www.joeydevilla.com/2013/03/29/an-honest-cable-and-internet-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey for this find</a>.
