I also like social media, and I'm a big believer in the strength of those online tools. It's why I accepted the offer of <a href="https://www.lockecommunications.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy A. Locke</a> when she asked me if I wanted to be part of a roundtable discussion at the McGill Writing Centre around Social Media.</p><p>I should have written this post way before today as the event is <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mwc/social-media-roundtable-discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Thursday from 18:00 to 21:00</a>. The friends <a href="https://newraycom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Hiltz</a>, and <a href="https://luislondon.com/category/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luis London</a> will be there with me, as two people I'll have the pleasure to meet, <a href="https://matthew.burpee.ca/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Burpee</a>, and Lisa Ursano. To give you a better idea of the event, here is a part of the description on their website:</p><em>... for a roundtable discussion on the relatively new and rapidly evolving world of social media. What role do social media play in marketing and public relations strategy? What impact do social media have on content authoring? What skills do writers need to enter this important market and benefit from these critical communication and collaboration platforms? To blog or not to blog? Facilitated by Nancy A. Locke, who teaches the MWC’s course on Writing for Digital Media, this event provides an opportunity for participants to gain insight into how design, communication, and marketing principles shape our social media encounters, and to raise questions about the role of social media in our private and public lives.</em><strong>This event is a paid one, so <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mwc/social-media-roundtable-discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get your ticket</a> while it last if you want to chat with us about social media in today lives!</strong>
