<figure><img alt="Stephane_Guidoin_and_Fred" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stephane_Guidoin_and_Fred.jpg"/></figure><p>Let's start this week with another interview I did for <a title="Make Web Not War TV – An unfinished project" href="https://fred.dev/make-web-not-war-tv-an-unfinished-project/">the project that I never had the time to finish at Microsoft</a>, the Make Web Not War TV. This time, I did a couple of interviews at <a href="https://confoo.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confoo</a> last year, and one of them was with <a href="https://twitter.com/Hoedic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stéphane Guidoin</a>. Stéphane is a well-known activist around Open Data in Montréal, and in Québec so obviously, we mainly talked about Open Data. We discussed about what Open Data is, what it means for us, <a href="https://opennorth.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open North</a>, <a href="https://montrealouvert.net/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Montréal Ouvert</a>, <a href="https://quebecouvert.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Québec Ouvert</a> (in French), and how to create a project or a product by using freely available data from governments, cities, and even private enterprises.</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa90FzBr0JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Personally, <a title="MaMairie.ca, une plateforme de participation citoyenne" href="https://fred.dev/mamairie-ca-une-plateforme-de-participation-citoyenne/">I'm a big fan of Open Data</a> (in French), but those organizations really need our help to make it better. I worked closely with Open Data project with Make Web Not War, and let me tell you that it's not easy as the main problem actually is the quality, and availability of the data feeds. Did you know about Open Data? Did you work on an Open Data project? Do you think it's valuable to have those open data feeds? Share your thoughts.</p>
