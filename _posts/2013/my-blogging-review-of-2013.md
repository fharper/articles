It's not something I was doing, but as I was looking at the posts I did during the last year, and I thought it could be a good idea to create a small review of 2013. Last year, I wrote 202 (203 including the one that will go out tomorrow) posts: they aren't all good, and some of them are what I'm calling quick post (like a tweet - a quote, an image...), but it's still a lot of posts!</p><h2>My five most popular (number of views)</h2><ol><li><a href="http://fred.dev/im-leaving-microsoft-looking-for-a-new-opportunity/">I’m leaving Microsoft, looking for a new opportunity</a></li><li><a title="I’m joining Mozilla" href="http://fred.dev/im-joining-mozilla/">I’m joining Mozilla</a></li><li><a href="http://fred.dev/so-you-want-to-be-an-evangelist/">So you want to be an Evangelist?</a></li><li><a href="https://fred.dev/the-startup-bullshit/">The startup bullshit</a></li><li><a href="http://fred.dev/do-you-want-to-become-the-next-technical-evangelist-at-microsoft-canada/">Do you want to become the next Technical Evangelist at Microsoft Canada?</a></li></ol><p>So it seems that in 2013, my most popular posts were about my career: at first, I was sad, as I wrote many posts I'm proud of that didn't reach these many people, but on second thought, it's awesome. It's awesome because it's what gave me a lot of great offers when I was ready to take my next challenge: I had the luxury to choose what was going to be next, and I'm very happy now at Mozilla.</p><h2>My five preferred ones (unordered)</h2><ul><li><a href="http://fred.dev/the-magic-happens-out-of-your-comfort-zone/">The magic happens out of your comfort zone</a></li><li><a href="http://fred.dev/you-have-no-excuses-just-do-it/">You have no excuses: just do it!</a></li><li><a href="http://fred.dev/you-cant-please-everyone-get-over-it/">You can’t please everyone, get over it</a></li><li><a href="https://fred.dev/tomorrow/">Tomorrow</a></li><li><a href="http://fred.dev/dont-accept-the-status-quo/">Don’t accept the status quo</a></li></ul><p>It wasn't easy for me to make this list, but there is no surprise as those are the kind of posts I like the most to write: it's all about trying to be better, challenging people and have an amazing life. Funny enough, they all have been written during December, and end of November: my style has changed, my writing English has improved, and for me, those are shorter, but more impactful. To end this small list, I'll add to this <a href="http://fred.dev/my-life-manifesto-v2/">my life manifesto v2</a> as it's a mantra that drives me day to day, and I was happy to share it with others. I'll also add another one: <a title="How to be a good attendee | Out of Comfort Zone" href="http://fred.dev/how-to-be-a-good-attendee/">how to be a good attendee</a>. As a public speaker, it's a post I wanted to write for a long time, and certainly one I'll link to quite often in the future.</p><p>Most of the time, the most popular ones aren't the one you are the more proud of. Blogging for me is a critical part of who I am, my professional career, my role as an Evangelist, and my <a title="I’m working on a personal branding book for developers" href="https://fred.dev/im-working-on-a-personal-branding-book-for-developers/">personal branding</a>. It's a way to share my opinions, my knowledge, my crazy side, my technical skills, my <em>life coach side</em>, and more. I'm looking forward to blog even more in 2014.</p><p>P.S.: If you enjoyed my posts (with no ads), consider a small gift on my <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/registry/wishlist/19JXODN4D2RUX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon wishlist</a> or an <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004M5HIQI/gcrnsts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon eGift card</a> (as an example: you cannot give a Kindle book - I have many in my list)</p>
