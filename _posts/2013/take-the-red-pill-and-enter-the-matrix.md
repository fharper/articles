I just found in my draft folder a post about an online presentation I did one year ago on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebMatrix</a>. Even if the software as evolved in the last year, and that it wasn't one of my priority anymore, I thought it would be nice to share this video as I think WebMatrix is a good lightweight IDE for Web, and PHP developers (note that didn't use it since a year, as I was mainly using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio</a> as my main IDE, and now <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sublime Text</a>). It's a also a good way for me to see how I improve my spoken English :)
