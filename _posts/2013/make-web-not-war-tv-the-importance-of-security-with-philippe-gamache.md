<img alt="Philippe_Gamache_and_Fred" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Philippe_Gamache_and_Fred.png" width="600" height="347" />The last interview I did at the <a href="https://confoo.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confoo</a> conference in 2012, but also the last video I did for this [unfinished Make Web Not War TV project][1] was with[Philippe Gamache</a, a security expert in Montreal. I'll miss posting those, but I'm missing a lot more meeting awesome people, and interviewing them, so stay tuned; I may have something else for you soon. Now let's see how two French guy are chatting in English on video...<div class="embed video YouTube">

Since Philippe is a security expert, and a former leader of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Montr%C3%A9al" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Montreal chapter of OWASP</a> (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Web Application Security Project</a>), security was the main driver of this discussion. Philippe highlighted the importance of security in all the process of building software: that means from the design of your project, to the testing phase. I also asked Phil to give us some advice to help us think a lot more about security when building software. Did you know about OWASP? Are you really taking care of security in the creation process of your application? Share your thoughts!][2]
