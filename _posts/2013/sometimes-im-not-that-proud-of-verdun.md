    Seriously? I mean, the wall painting was not beautiful, and now, they added some distaff to fit the wall. At least, if it was for kids I would understand, but there is nothing there for kids: no toys, no sand, no water fountain... I pass in front of this quite often, and I rarely see people enjoying the precious moment they have in this <em>wonderful</em> swamp, and of course, our taxes probably paid this!

P.S.: For those not in Montreal, Verdun is the neighborhood in which I live in Montreal.
