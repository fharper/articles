I've been the Microsoft guy in Montreal (Quebec) for almost three years, so I still get requests about Microsoft technology or events. Since [I've moved to a new gig][1], I thought it would be great to give some visibility to my replacement, <a href="https://ramisayar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rami Sayar</a>! It's not that I don't want to help people, but I may not be the best person to help now, since [I'm not at the Empire anymore][2].

I'm really glad that Microsoft Canada chose Rami as the new guy for many reasons: he speaks French, he  is all about Open Source, he is involved in the Montreal tech scene, and he is more brilliant than me. So brilliant that he manages to get the role, even if we were looking for someone with more years of experience! So if you want to touch base with Ramy for anything Microsoft, mostly related to technical stuff, of course, feel free to contact him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramisayar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/ramisayar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. Congratulations to the new Technical Evangelist, and welcome, a bit late, to Microsoft!

P.S.: Two different style on the picture, Rami is classier than me, but hey, it's Bill Murray!
