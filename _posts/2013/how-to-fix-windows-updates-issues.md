Since a couple of days, I wanted to be able to help developers under OS X, so I figured out that it would be a good idea to reinstall OS X, and have a dual boot (yes, I should have done this right at the beginning, don't ask). The problem is that once you install Windows as the only OS, there is no way (at least no way I found, and nobody was able to help me) to reinstall OS X. I had to format my computer, reinstall OS X, and install Windows again right after. I thought that yesterday evening would have been a good idea as I had time, but it gave me more problems than I thought.</p><p>Funny enough, I never had any problems with Windows Updates when I was a Microsoftie, but since yesterday I had many problems: failed to update, failed to download... I tried many things to fix it, but the instructions in this video saved me.</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kH3jJ1tpCDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Currently, everything is working well, and I now have a dual boot working perfectly. I just wanted to share this information with you as it may help you at some point. Next step, I may try to make it a triple boot machine with Ubuntu (it's been a while my friend), so I'll be fully functional to help all kinds of developers build their amazing Firefox OS application.</p>
