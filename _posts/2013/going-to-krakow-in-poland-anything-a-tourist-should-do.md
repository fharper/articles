I'm very fortunate to have a job which gives me the opportunity to travel. When [I was at Microsoft][2], I used to <a href="https://www.tripit.com/people/fredericharper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel a lot</a> in Canada, and every time I had the chance to go somewhere brand new, I was taking two days off to do the tourist. I like to discover unknown places, new cultures, and there is no reason that it will chance with my [new role at Mozilla][3]. Except that now, the travels aren't limited to Canada. The next place I'm visiting is Krakow, in Poland, and I'll take two days to visit a little.

What I try to do when I'm going somewhere is to ask people who live there or people who already travel to that city or country. I want to maximize my time there as two days is not that long. As an example, the last time I took some days off is when I went into Seattle. I asked some friends there, and they send me some good suggestions: the advantage of doing this is that you can get nice spots that aren't known by tourists. So the last two days I took in Seattle, I went to a museum, the first Starbucks, the best place for donuts, a really nice marketplace, I did an underground tour, went to a tower with a breathtaking view (I'll do a more complete post to share my cool post to visit)... I would say that half of them would have been on my list as I did some search, but I would have missed the other half of nice things I did. Since I believe a lot in the power of our network, I'll try to crowd source my visit to Krakow, hoping Polish people read my blog, or friends who traveled there.

I didn't start to check yet what I want to do, but I'll have about two days off before I work, so what would you suggest me to do? What is the thing a tourist must do when he goes to Krakow? Any secret places I would need to visit or things I need to try/food that may not be as known? I also plan to do a recapitulation post after to share what I did with others, so next time, if you want to go there, you'll have a good list of stuff to do, and as well to see.
