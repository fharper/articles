It was a mix of good practices for the UI, the UX, and the integration you should do with the Windows 8 features to give a great experience to your users.</p><p>I'm no way near to be a design expert (trust me, I suck to design beautiful applications), but as a developer, and a user, I know what makes a good experience, and I know when an application sucks. Developers tend to minimize the impact of the details by considering the fact that their application has all the amazing features a customer who needs. Let me tell you this: if your application is ugly, don't give me a good experience or have no integration with the platform, people won't use it. They will check for alternative, and you will lose a user.
