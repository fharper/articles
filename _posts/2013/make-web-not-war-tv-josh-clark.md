I meet <a href="https://globalmoxie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Clark</a> at the first edition of <a href="https://gobeyondpixels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Beyond Pixels</a>, and it was a real pleasure to meet him: he always has a smile on his face, and he is a very nice guy. When I saw he was speaking at the <a href="https://webaquebec.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web à Québec</a>, I immediately asked him to do an interview for the [never born Make Web Not War TV project][1]. We mainly talk about design, and great mobile experiences. The author of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1449381650/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=1449381650&linkCode=as2&tag=outofcomzon-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tapworthy </a>also addressed sensors, touch devices, the Internet of things, the future, and we briefly argue about Star Trek vs Star Wars. <div class="embed video YouTube">

  What is a great mobile experience for you? Should we always design for touch? What will be the future of the Web? Share your thoughts.
