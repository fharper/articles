You don't have to tell me: I know I'm lucky to have a job that gives me the opportunity to travel. At the end of the month, I'll go to Guadalajara in Mexico for a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/10/new-app-workshops-mx-hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox OS workshop</a>, and I'll take two days off to visit.

As usual, I'm using my network to get some insights about what do to in this city that I never visited before. It's been the fourth time I'm doing this (the first time by email, and the last two with blog posts), and it served me well: every time I got amazing suggestions from people, thanks a lot. It helped me to find good places to go, astonishing restaurants for excellent dinner, café I shouldn't miss, and more. Of course, there are places that all tourists should go, but people also introduce me to less-known places that I didn't want to miss. For me, visiting a new city is all about going to specific attraction, but also just walking through the streets with no destinations: it's usually an amazing experience.

So, anyone from Mexico that have great insights? Did you travel to Guadalajara? Do you have any secret spot I should know about? Any stuff a tourist shouldn't miss? Please let me know.
