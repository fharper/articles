The principle was simple: I choose three words that will help me drive my years in the direction that I want. I see those like a moving part of <a title="My life manifesto v2" href="http://fred.dev/my-life-manifesto-v2/">my life manifesto</a>. Since we are in the last day of the year, I think it's a good time to review those.</p><p>It was the first time I did this exercise, and I have the intention to do it again for the next year (they are almost already chosen). For my first attempt, my three words were: kaizen, time, and discovery.</p><h2>Kaizen</h2><p>Kaizen is a Japanese word that roughly says: continuos improvement. This is a word that I would be able to take every year without reaching an end. I think I managed pretty well my life in 2013 with this principle in mind, but mostly on one aspect: <a title="Three months as a Mozillian" href="http://fred.dev/three-months-as-a-mozillian/">my career</a>. <a title="Work hard, play hard" href="https://fred.dev/work-hard-play-hard/">I'm not one of those crazy people who likes to work 80 hours a week</a>, even if I enjoy a lot my job, but it's still something super important for me: I need to wake up in the morning, and like what I'm doing for a living. At the end, we give an enormous part of our life to exchange duties against money: it's kind of crazy when you think about it. At the beginning of 2013, <a title="I’m leaving Microsoft, looking for a new opportunity" href="http://fred.dev/im-leaving-microsoft-looking-for-a-new-opportunity/">I wasn't totally happy anymore with my job</a>, so <a title="I’m joining Mozilla" href="http://fred.dev/im-joining-mozilla/">I made the switch</a>, and I'm really happy about it. I also think that I'm a better evangelist today. As the perfectionism that I am, I see many more aspects in my personal, and professional life that I would like to improve, but I'm satisfied about the journey I had until now.</p><h2>Time</h2><p>This one was probably the hardest for me: I was tired of constantly running, having a full agenda, and always have stuff that I need to do. I end up all my projects, refuse many, and <a title="Focus" href="http://fred.dev/focus/">concentrate on three important aspect of my life</a>: my job, my blog, and my friends/family. It was a difficult step for me, but even if I didn't really learn how to stop, and relax, I had way more time to try it. I also didn't have the stress of working on many things at once, or running many projects. I now like to do my personal stuff, so I can do it on my own pace.</p><h2>Discovery</h2><p>This one was really about learning, and discovering. I managed to go less to the same restaurant or coffee shop this year. I took time to try activities I never did before, and even visit places where I never went before, even in my hometown. Traveling was an integral part of my role at Mozilla, and in every city, I took some days off to visit. Just in the last four months, I visited San Jose in US, Krakow in Poland, Brussels in Belgium, Guadalajara in Mexico, Budapest in Hungary, and Athens in Greece. It's six new cities, and five countries I never travel to before! Even if this word won't be in my list for next year, it will always be omnipresent...</p><p>In retrospective, even if this year went blazingly fast, I'm quite happy with it, and I'm looking forward to another amazing one...</p>
