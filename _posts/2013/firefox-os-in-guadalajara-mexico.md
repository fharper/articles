Since we were in a workshop, my primary goal was to help developers be able to build their applications without any problem: my talk was mostly about the Firefox OS Simulator, and the Web developer tools inside of Firefox. I really like to show off those tools to developers, as many people just don't know about them: there isn't only FireBug! It is helping me every time I'm creating a Web application, website or helping other developers. If you didn't have the chance to use them, open Firefox, go to the tools menu, open them, and have fun!</p><p>P.S.: Wonder what is the relation between the picture, and this post? It was taken during the dinner with attendees after the workshop. It's a pitiable, but funny, reproduction of the Evolution, and I thought it would make sense for Firefox OS as for me, it's the evolution of the mobile web (if there is such a thing like a mobile web).</p>
