Those are two topics that really passionate me. I did a couple of presentations on this topic when <a title="I’m leaving Microsoft, looking for a new opportunity" href="http://fred.dev/im-leaving-microsoft-looking-for-a-new-opportunity/">I was at Microsoft</a>, and there is no reason why I should stop right now, as it's still very important.</p><div class="embed rich SlideShare"><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/FKQpukFCgeaiAE" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px;margin-bottom:5px;max-width:100%" allowfullscreen> </iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper/responsive-web-design-web-php-conference-20130918" title="Responsive Web Design - Web &amp; PHP Conference - 2013-09-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsive Web Design - Web &amp; PHP Conference - 2013-09-18</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frédéric Harper</a></strong></div></div><p>As usual, note that the slides are only for the attendees, as they won't make sense for you if you weren't there. I finally start CamStudio before my presentation, so here is a screencast of my talk: note that it was recorded with the microphone of my computer, and I'm moving a lot on the stage when I'm presenting, so the sound is not always good (on top of that, it's echo because of the room, and the microphone I had - I'm looking for a better way to do it - maybe a wireless mic to my computer). I hope it'll help the attendees to grab bits they may have missed, or to learn more about the topic for people who weren't there.</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfpu4o5S6AM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Did you know about Responsive Web Design? Do you think it's important to support more viewports than just the usual size of a desktop screen? Did you use Responsive Web Design for web sites or web applications development? Do you plan to use it in the future? Share your thoughts.</p>
