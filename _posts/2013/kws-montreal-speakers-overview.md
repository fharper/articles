<a href="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kws.png"><img alt="kws" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kws.png" width="600" height="328"/></a<p>I really like the promotional video that the people behind <a href="https://www.kws-forum.org/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kongossa Web Series (KWS) Montreal</a> did, and trust me; it's not because I'm in. I think it's seriously a good way to showcase some of the local talks, and excite people a little more about what they'll be able to see at this conference. I'm really happy to be one of the speakers, and for this one, I'll go out of my usual technical talks: at the end, I have more passion than just development (oh dear, is it possible?!).</p><div class="embed video YouTube"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M49P8ChHeIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>I'm very excited to be able to <a title="Kongossa Web Series Montreal" href="https://fred.dev/kongossa-web-series-montreal/">share my point of view about personal branding</a>, and help people to understand why they should care. I already did a <a title="Social Media Breakfast Montreal and the personal branding" href="https://fred.dev/social-media-breakfast-montreal-and-the-personal-branding/">small conference about the topic</a> at <a href="https://www.smbmtl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media Breakfast</a>, and now I'll have the chance to do a full keynote on this pet peeve of mine. I'm happy to see that my replacement at Microsoft, <a href="https://ramisayar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rami Sayar</a>, who will be a rock star Evangelist, will also be there: a good way to connect with the new Microsoft guy in town! See you at KWS!</p><p>P.S.: Wow, at 0:55, they were able to make me smile!</p>
