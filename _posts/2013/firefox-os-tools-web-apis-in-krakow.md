[<img alt="fxos-krakow" src="http://fred.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fxos-krakow.jpg" width="600" height="1068" /></aToday I did two presentations at the Firefox Krakow workshop. The first one was an introduction to the tools you'll need to develop Firefox OS application: you don't need any special IDE, but you'll see that using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox OS simulator</a>, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Web Developer Tools</a> will help you a lot in developing your application.<div class="embed rich SlideShare">

</div>I also did a quick overview of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox OS Web APIs</a>. My goal wasn't to make all attendees experts with Web APIs, but to fill their brain with them: it's usually what you avoid doing as a speaker, but in my case, I wanted them to know that they exist, and are easy to use. You may not need them for your Firefox OS application, but if it happens, you'll know they exist. I mostly wanted developers to know that we have awesome documentations on the Mozilla Developer Network they can refer to whenever they are looking for something.<div class="embed rich SlideShare">

</div>Of course, slides are slides, they, by no mean, replace being at the presentation as they are only visual support: used them wisely! I'll try to record myself presenting them when I'll have free time (I forgot to start CamStudio when I was presenting). It was a real pleasure to visit Krakow, and Poland for the first time, and I hope the attendees got as excited as we are about Firefox OS. Remember, whether you were at the workshop or not, if you need any help with Firefox OS, <a href="mailto:fharper@mozilla.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please email me</a>. Ping me also if you don't need help, but submitted an application to the marketplace, I want to see what you did!I also did a quick overview of the Firefox OS Web APIs.
