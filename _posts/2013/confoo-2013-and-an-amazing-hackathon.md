This year again, the <a href="https://confoo.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confoo </a>conference will happen in Montreal at the end of February. I will be there, again, with the Make Web Not War team as we found that Confoo is a great place to learn, share, meet, and have fun! For the 2013 edition, we will have something special for the attendees, but we also planned an <a href="https://www.webnotwar.ca/make-web-not-war-hackathon-at-confoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing hackathon</a> for everybody, attendees or not! <a href="https://mwnwconfoohackathon.eventbrite.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign-up now</a> as places are limited.

Here is a promotional video of Confoo with some well-known faces of the industry including yours truly.
