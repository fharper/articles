I'll search for a new job tomorrow. I'll start to go to the gym tomorrow. I'll do my homework tomorrow. I'll clean up the house tomorrow. I'll write the book I always wanted to write tomorrow.</p><p>Tomorrow is our ennemy. Now is the friend you want to have. Tomorrow is a future that will never happen as after tomorrow, there is tomorrow. Now is the right moment to make it happen. Tomorrow is an excuse, not a point in time. Now is a synonym of action. Tomorrow is a lie to ourselves. Now is your chance to go out of your comfort zone, and do epic shit.</p>
