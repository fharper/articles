No matter if you are a fan of this man or Apple, we can agree on two things: he was a jerk, but he never accepted the status quo as a show stopper. I really enjoyed the movie as I recognized myself in it: don't get me wrong, I'm no way near to be the man he was, but I caught myself nod a couple of times like when Kutcher was reading this amazing quote:</p><blockquote>Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble-makers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently…they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</blockquote><p>I often see myself as a crazy one, someone who doesn't accept the status quo, a person who doesn't want to be average, a man who wants to make things happen, and to do epic shit... The status quo is a prison for your creativity: it's the limit that we collectively set to feel safe, but it's probably the less safe place to be. Starting now, be part of the crazy ones who push the human race forward...</p>
