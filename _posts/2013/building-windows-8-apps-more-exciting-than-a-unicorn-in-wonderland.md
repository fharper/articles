Since I did all the presentations on the first event they did 3-4 weeks ago, I was only doing the keynote to wake up the people on this Saturday morning. As usual, here are the slides I used for my presentation: <div class="embed rich SlideShare">

  Based on the underpants gnome business model, we took a quick 15 minutes to talk about why it's more exciting to build a Windows 8 application than being a unicorn in Wonderland. The plan was simple:
</p>

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Collect the tools;</span>
2.  Build the apps;
3.  Profit! I won't write more details about what I've said as the recording of my presentation will be available soon, so I'll do a blog post with the video as soon as it will be available. On this note, enjoy your Windows 8 coding, and let me know if I can help!
