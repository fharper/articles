Still part of the series of videos I did for the [Make Web Not War TV project I had][1] when [I was at Microsoft][2], I did an interview at <a href="https://confoo.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confoo</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/_bryanxu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Xu</a> from <a href="https://ideanotion.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IdeaNotion</a>. I had the please to work with the guys at IdeaNotion for an <a href="https://github.com/ideanotion/ideapress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source project</a>, <a href="https://ideapress.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroPress (now IdeaPress)</a> that was helping people to build Windows 8 application from their Wordpress blog.

In this interview, we talked about MetroPress, Wordpress, Windows 8, and of course, his company. If you want a good company for your projects, hire them! I'm now back in the Web, and prefer to get the full experience of a Web site or Web application, but it was a good project for what we had to achieve at that time. On your side, did you use MetroPress? Are you building Windows 8 applications? What do you like or not from the OS? Are you using Wordpress? Share your thoughts.
